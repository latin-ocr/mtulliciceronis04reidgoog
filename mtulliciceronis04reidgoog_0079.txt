62 THE ACADEMICAS'· OF etc-mro.

produced by objects vary when the subject is placed under varying
conditions os space¹. This line of attack was so thoroughly hackneyed
that Cicero did not expend much trouble in puisuing it'. Sixthly, the
effect produced by variations in other externa-l conditions besides those
esposicion was considered. Each sensation is affected by and mixed
up with other sensntions, and these act and react upon one another'.
This ohservation is not developed in the Academica, though it is involved
iu several passages·¹ Iu the seventh place, Sextus argues that different
quantities of the same material substance will make very different iin-
pressio-ts on the senses, and render it impossible to pronunnce what the
real qualiu'es of the substance ιιι-ε’. This contention received only
slight attention from Cicero‘. The eighth sceptica! method really sums
up in a general (οι-ιιι all the other uine. It shows that all judgment
which follows on sensation is relative to or conditioned by either the
peculiarities os the individua] subject, or the exten-tal circumstances by
which sensation is accompastied'A This principle in its general form is
nowhere exactly stated in the Academxca. Nor are the two succeeding
τρόποι represented there⁴ The ninth is based on the difference which
it makes to our judgrnent whether an object is of rzre or frequent oocur-
rence'; the tenth relates to the great variety of habits and manners and
socinl ideas prevailing among different nations'A

These ten τρόποι were ruore or less common to the earlier-sceptioe
and the New Academy, but in clearness and thoroughness Aenesidemus
made a conspicuous advance, both upon Pyrrho and upon Carneades¹¹.

Os the five ‘methods' adopted by the younger sceptiesn, one is
identical with the eighth of the earlier scheme while another, based on
the discord of huinnn judgrnertts ¹¹, sums up most„ if not all, of the re-
