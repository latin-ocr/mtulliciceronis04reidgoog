18 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Cicero’s temperament led him tn refusa it with horror-¹. On some
questions, as we have akeady seen, Cioero wavererl. In the De
Fimbus he argued that the differenee between the stuic and Peri-
patefit erhics was merely one os terrns; in the Tumalan Disputa-
tions he held it 10 be rea-l. The most stoic in tone os an his works
are the Tusculan Disputations and the De Offi'tiis'.

The third branch os philosophy, that concerncd with natural pheno-
rnena, was in Cicero's age accounted os small imponar-ree compared
with ethice. Physica] investigations were only valued sor the effect they
might have on ethica] speculation or practice. Cicero esteerned physica!
science mainly as a sorrn os culture'. The atomism os the Epicureans
and the pantheistic materialem of the scoies were alike directed to secur-
ing sor the wise man the perfect repose os mind which was necessary sor
the full realisarion os his exhieal ideal. In all ancient systems, theology
was reeognised as a division os natural science. The religious element
in Cicero's nature inclined him very strongly to sympathise with the
Stoic views os the grand universal operation of divine power. Piery,
purity, and moral good were impossible in any form, he thought, is
the divine govemment os the universe were denied‘. He was grieved
that Carneades should have round it necessary to oppose the beautiful
stoi: theology, and he defends the great sceptic hy the plea that his
one aim was to rouse rnen to the investigation os the trinh'. The
snmlistie and pantheistic aspect os the Stoic physieS, which was ac-
cepted by Antiochus‘, Cicero rejected, as became a sollowcr os Car-
neades, who had spent much os his lise in ridiculing the Stoic εἱμαρμένη,
In the general outlines os physice, Cicero chiefly followed Antiochus,
whose scheme is propounded in the Academica Posteriora. That
philosopher, while owing much to the scoies, drcw largely upon the
Timaeus os Plato, a work which Cicero knew and translated, though
like all other readers os the dialogue he found it hard to understand&
Many of the Stoic notium which entered into the Antiochean physics
were ultimately derived {rom Aristode, but the physica] treatises of
that philosopher were in Cicero*s time inaccessible, or at all events
