52 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

ment is only a literary device. No orie can read the speech os Lucullus
without perceiving that Cicero wrote lt with a Greek work lying open
before him, sroru which almost every sentence has been directly trans-
ferred* This hook was iu ull probability the Sosus, a dialogue in which
Antiochus attadzed the views os his old teucher Philo¹. The tenus in
which Cicero speaks os it show that it covered exactly the same ground
as the discussions which Lucullus professes to report- The Sosus was
probably divided into several books, one of them containing a purely
personui uttack upon Philo, which Cioero passed over in writing the
Academica'.

The sources os the seeptical arguments in the Academica are scarcely
less clear. Α work os Philo, twice mentioned, though not by my definite
tirle'. supplied Cioero with the historica! justificatior: osthe New Amderny
which, in the first edition, he opposed to the speech os Hortensius, and
in the second to that of ναι-ω’. From the same work, in all probability.
carue the historiml references placed al the outset os Cicero's speech in
the Lucullus& It is not quite so easy to trace to their origin the usgu-
ments by which Cicero showed the delusive nature os senseknowledge.
They were comrnorvplaces of debate used by zll philosophical sceptics
from Pyrrho to Sextus. lt is more probable that they were here bor-
rowed [τοι-ιι Clitomachus thnn from any other writer'. The ‘four heads’
os the sceptic argument, which Cicero in his later speech mentions in
close connexion with the criticism directed in his earlier speech against
the seuses, are entirely iu the style os Clitomachus! The same book
undoubtedly supplied Cicero with the ruore elaborate criticism on the
bases os knowledge which he embodied in his second speech‘. Tradition
has, however, only handed down to us the titles os a few os the sour
hundred books which Clitomachus is said to have written, and no one
of these titles suits the circumstances os the present case.

Cicero next gives two extracts relating to the constructive side os
Carneades' philosophy, taken from two works os Clitomachus which
he nunes'. The rest os his speech in the Lucullus is devoted to an ex-
hibition os the hopeless discord which the history of philosophy presents.
