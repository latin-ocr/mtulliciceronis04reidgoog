his Latinised name ‘Henricus Alanus’ This us is a small quarto,
written on parchment with great care ; few mistalres in iz ean be ascribed
to the copyist. In parts the inlr is rnbbed away, but the forms of the
letters are so deeply impressed on the parchment that, with care, the
readings can always be made out⁴ The centenos axe—Amdemlea Poste-
riom, De legffius, De natura deorum, De divinitatwne, Desato, Timaeus, ⁴
(De mundo), Somnium Sa'pionis. At the end eomes Academica L with

with the words tx Epirum Zenone in 5 46, and has no proper subscrip-
tion, but merely the remark ‘non repmdtur (sic) plus! The us bears
the book-plane of the well-known Conrad von Uffenbach, who probably

dem-um⁴ The collation which Halm used ms supplied to him hy the
