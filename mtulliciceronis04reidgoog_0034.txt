INTRODUCTION Ι 7

to assure to moral principles a sound basis had sor Cicero a great at-
traction. He was, in his later days, fascinated by the Stoies almost
beyond the power os resistance. In respect o( their ethical and religi-
ous ideas he calls thern ⁴ great and famous philosophers¹,' and he fre<
quently speaks with something like shsme of the “catinent they had
received nt the hands of Arcesilas md Carneades. Once he expresses a
sear lest they should be the only true philosophers aster all'. There was
a magnificence about the Stoie utterances on morality, more suited to a
superhumm than a human world. which allured Cicero more than the
barrenness of the stoic dialectie repelled him'. In a remarkable pas-
sage‘, he assents to the distinctively Stoic doctrine that virtue is incapable
of degree, and expressly rejects the position os Antiochus that a lise
enriched by virtue but unatrended by other advantages might be happy,
but could not be the happiest possible. He begs the Academia and
Peripateti: Schools to cease from giving an uncertain sound', and to
allow that the happiness os the wise man would remnin unimpaired
even is he were thrust into the bull os Pha-laris. Iu another place he
admits the purely Stoic doctrine that virtue is one and indivisible'.
These opinions, however, he will not allow to be distinctively Stoic, but ,
appeals to Socrates as his authority for them’. Zeno, who is merely an
ignoble crastsman os words, stole them from the older philosophers os
the Acade-ny, T'his is Cicero's general feeling with περι-ἀ to Zeno,
and there can be no doubt that he caught it from Antiochus who, in
stenling the doctrines os Zeno, ever stoutly maintained that Zeno had
stolen them before. Cicero, however, regarded chiefly the ethius os
Zeno with this feeling, while Antiochus so regarded chiefly the dialectic-
12 is just in this that the main difference between Antiochus and Cicero
lies, To the former Zeno's dialectic was true and Socratic, while the
latter treated it as umSocratic, looking upon Socrates as the apostle os
doubt'. On the whole Cicero went beyond Antiochus in his sympathy
with the Stoic ethim. Not at every point. however, for while Antia
chus accepted without reserve the Stoic paradoxes, Cicero hesitatingly
allowed them, though he admitted that they were Socratic'. Again,
Antiochus subscribed to the Stoic theory that all emotion was sinsul ς
