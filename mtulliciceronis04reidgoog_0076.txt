INTRODUCTION. 59

seems to have set up a eontrast between the exores-ic and the emteric
doctrines os the New Academy, though his opponent-5 asked in vain
what the latter were', and Clitomachus, the pupil and successor of
Carneades, declared that he had never been able to discover the real
opinion or his master concerning any topic whatever'.

Philo then assigned his own positive teuching, whatever it was, to
his predecessors in the school. Cicero nowhere in the Amdem'az
direetly defends his accurncy on this point, but he does indireetly try
to reestablish the impaired credit of his flavo-:rite master. Thus he
repeatedly implies that [he unsavourable judgmem pronounced upon
Philo was in great part mnsed by the sailnre of his critice to realise the
constructive doctrines os Carneades>

The most probable conjecture about Philo's own opinion is, 1 think,
this. He maintained that the impressions os sense give in the vast
majority} of instances a correct picture of the objects which cause duem>
We may therefore make confident assertions as to their truth, where we
see no reason to suspect their salsehoorh Only, while we may be sure that
in the overwhelmingly larger number os instantes our judgrnent will be
right, yet in no one particular instance ean we be absolutely certain that
it is sor This conjecture aocords with Philo’s vindimtion os the serious-
ness os emendes assertioni that the persectly wise rnan will feel free to
pronounce definite opinions though he knows he annot absolutely
prove thern( We may suppose that this view agreed roughly with the
opinions of the Peripatetics at this time'. lt would therefore seem a
subsuntial noncession to dogmatism'.

One thing which closely ooneerns the Atademica, but which is very
difficult to determine, is the date at which Philo changed his opinions.
The view of andis' that the two books which excited the wath of
Antiochus were written before Philo came to Rome, is exeeedingly
improbable At the tirne when Cicero first heard his lectura, he almost
eemimy taught nothing but the doctrine os Carneades. Now Philo's
