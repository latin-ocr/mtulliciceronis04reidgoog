26 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

former passage os the ‘moa Aristotelias' [⁴ in quo sermo im induci-
tur ceterorum ut penes ipsum sit principatus] this judgment is not
strictly correct⁴

It has been explained that Cicero's philosophical works are in sub-
stance translations, though free translations, from Greek originals. The
Greek works on which they are founded have, with the exception of
a few passages, for the most part unimportant, been lost. ln fact these
works os Cicero are, for most of the subjects with which they deal, the
oldest authorities we now possess, and in many portioris they are the
only authorities It is therefore of importance to determine how far
they ean be trusted as representing the sources srorn which they were
drawn. This question can only be decided by laborious investiga-
tion into the whole os the existing ancient testimony to the doctrines
of the post-Aristotelian schools. In spite os all that has been done in
recent times, the task is one which still in substance ren-mins for
scholar-s to accomplish. There ean be no doubt at the present moment
that a low estimate prevails of Cicero's accuracy and of the value of
his wriiingst Long observation andinquiry has, however, eonvinced
me that this estimate rests almost entirely on misconception or preju-
dice. It is impossible sor me here to treat of the matter to any extent
in detail; 1 can only indicate in a general way what appear to be
sorne of the chief sources uf prevalent errors concerning the worth
of Cicero’s philosophical works. Personal prejudice against the man,
derived froin a consideration os his politica! carcer, has produced much
effect ', But with this matter 1 cannot here deal

The most mreless readers cannot fail to find in the philosophical
writings of Cicero many superficial contradictions und inconsistennies,
much inconstancy in the use of terius, no little inconsequence in
argument, and considerable want os lucidity in the arrangement os
subject-marten When these faults are observed it is the practice of
some scholars to lay the guilt at Cicero’s door, and ιο let the Greeks
go free from blame( Now Ι do not hesitare to assert that the further
inquiry is pushed into the sources os :he post-Aristotelian philosophy,
the rnore plainly will the fact corne to light that the dcsects complained
of existed already in the Greek authors whom Cicero copied. ln the
whole of the Greek philosophy the feeling for consistency is found
