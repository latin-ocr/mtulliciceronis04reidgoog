INTRODUCTIOM 5³

1 conjecture that Cicero here depended mainly on a work os Clitomachus
mentioned by Diogenes Laenius, which probably contained a critical
history os philosophy'- In the course of his remarks Cicero uses a
small fragment of alost dialogue by Aristode'. The only allusions to
other philos->phem in the later part of Cicero’s speech in the Lusullus
are such as to confirm the supposition that it was almost wholly derived
from Clitomachus'l

Our analysis os the subject-matter os the Academica leads therefore
to the following conclusion 1t was composed os two long fragments os
Antiochus taken from different works, two os Philo from the same
work, four of Clitomachus from three or four different works. No
attempt was made to ret-ast or rearnnge the subject-matter. lt is to
the last degree improbable that Cicero even condensed or made
omissions to any considerable extent. He merely set the fmgments
in the framework os the dialogue. The looel seenery, the illustmtions
stom Roman history and the connecting links, constitute au «hat is due
to his own invention. So {ar ns philosophy is concerned, the passages
which Cicero supplies eom-ain nothing which was not notorious and
vell known to every man os culture in his day. In estimating, there-⁴
sore, the philosophioel value os the whole work, the reader must put
Cicero's personality almost entirely out of sight, and look beyond him
m Clitomachus, Philo and Antiochus. The only question personal ιο
Cicero which cm arise touches his fidelity as n translator. Few possess,
