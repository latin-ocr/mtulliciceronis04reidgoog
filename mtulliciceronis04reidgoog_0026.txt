his tastu books, letters, surely, all in their turn became unpleasant ¹.

As soon as Cicero had become fully reconciled to Caesar in the
year 46 he returned with desperate energy to his old literary pursuits⁴
In a letter written ro Varro in thar year', he says, ⁴1 assure you 1
had no sooner returned ro Rorne than 1 renewed my intimacy with
my old friends, roy booksss These gave him real comfort, and his
studies seerned to bear richer fruit thau in his days of prosperiry'.
The tenor of all his letters at this time is the same: see especially the
remaining letters to Varro and also to Sulpicius ¹. The Partitiones
Oraton'as, the Paradoxa, the Orator, und the laudatio Catonis, to
which emar replied by his Anticalo, were all finished within the year.

time had he been divor-ced sroru philosophy ¹. He was entitled ω meet
the charge made by some people ou the publication os his first book
of the later period—the Hortensius—that he was a mere tiro in phi-
losophy, by the assertion that on the contrary nothing had more 00-
cupied his thoughts throughout the whole of a wonderfully energetic
lise'. His knowledge os philosophy must os course be estin-med ulti-
mately by his exunt work& Thaee have been severely judged by some
leading scholam os recent times, but on wholly insufficient grounds
