24 THE ACADEMIcS OF CICERO.

could not be thoroughly understood till the whole subject lud been
mastered¹. This design then, which is not explicitly stated iu the
two earliest works which we possess, the Academica and Da Finibus,
required the composition os ι sort ol* philosophica] encyclopudia.
In nccordance will. Greek precedent, Cicero claimed to have his books
on rhetoric and politis, nearly all οἱ thern published before the writlngs
which belong to philosophy in the modern sense, included in the circle
os his philosophica works'. It is no part os my plan to enumerate

It will be necessary now lo consider the method on which Cicero
constructed his philosophical trcatises, As we have seen, lle made
no claim to originality. 1-1e did nol even suppose himself to possets a
special and technical knowledge os what had been written orl the
subiect! His early edumtion, however, and subsequam reading had
given him a good general acquaintance wilh the principles os the post-
Aristotelian schools, which he doeired lo explzin to his selloweounlry-
rnen. But he never ventured to set sonh those principles according to
any {ashion or arrangement os his own. His books are in no sense
compilations srolrl a number os different sources< When he wished to
set before his readers the view taken by any school about any par-
ticular topic, he selected sorne one work relatiug lo it, by an acknow-
lodged master os the school. This he kept to very closely indeed ς
his writings mre, in fact, to a great extent translations, though free
translations, from the Greek sources In no other way could the
cnorrnous mass ol' literature, which he ponred forth in the last few
years os his life, have been produced‘. He construcled his philoso—
