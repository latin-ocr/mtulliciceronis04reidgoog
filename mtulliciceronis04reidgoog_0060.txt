INTRODUCTION. 4 3

representation οἱ tlte older Academias& The rnost important part os
the speech, however, must have consisted in a desenoe os Came-des and
Arcesilas against the dogmat-ic schools'. Catulus evidently concerned
himself more with the system of the later than with that os the earlier
teaclier. lt is also exceedingly probable tlwt he touched only very
lightly on the negative Academia: arguments³ while he developed sully
that positive teaching about the τιθανόν which was so distinctive of
Carneads. All the counter arguments os Lucullus which concern the
destructive side of Academia teaching appear to be distinctly aimed
at Cicero, who must have represented it in tlte discoume os the day
hesore'. On the other hand. those parts of Lucullus¹ speech which deul
with the oonstructive part os Academicisrn‘ seem to he intended for
Catulus, to whom the rnaintenance os the genuine Carneadem distine-
tion between ἄδηλα and ἀκατάληπτα would be u peculiarly congenial rask
Thus the oomrnendation bustowed by Lucullus on the way in which the
probabile had been handled appennine to Catulus. The exposition os
the sceptical criticjsm would naturally be reserved sor the most brilliant
orator of the party—Cicero himselt These conjectures have the ad-
vantage os establishing an intimate connexion between tlte prooemium,
the speech os Catulus, and the succeeding speech of Hortensius. In the
prooemium the innovations of Philo were mentioned; Catulus then
shewed that the only object simod at by thern, a satisfactory basis for
ἐπιστήμη, was already attained by the Carneadan theory ol' tlte new:
whereupnn Hortensius showed, after the principles os Antiochus, that
such a basis was provided by the older philosophy, which both eas-
neades and Philo had wrongly abandoned. Thus Philo becomes the
centu-al point or pivot os the discussion. With this arrangement none of
the indications in the Lamum clnsh⁴ Even the demand made by Hor-
tensius upon Catulus* need only imply such a bare statement on tlte
part of the latter os the negative Areesilaean doctrines as would clear
the ground sor the Carneadean πιθανόν. One important opinion main-
tained by Catulus aster Carneades, that the wise man would opine⁸, 121.
would deliver himself os opinions, though he knew they rested on no
sure and certain foundations (νόν σοφὰν δοξάσειν), seems another indica-
tion os the generally constructive character of his exposition. Every-
thing points to the conclusion that this part us the dialogue was mainly
drawn by Cicero from the writings os Clitomachus.
