INTRODUCTIOM 33
not the Academica then the De ffnffiusk Cicero had never been very
intimate with Varr03 their acquaintance seems to hnve been maintained
through Atticus, who was at all times anxious to draw them more
closely together. Nine years earlier he had pressed Cicero to find
roem in his works sor some honounhle employment o! Varro’s name&
The nature of the works on which Cicero was then engaged rendered it
difficult for him to comply with the request⁸. Varro had promised on
his side to dedimte to Cicero an important work In znswer to the
later entreuty os Atticus, Cicero declared himself very much dissutisfied
with Varro’s failure to sulfil his promise. From this it is evident that
Cicero knew nothing of the scope or magnitude of the De lingua
Latina, a portion os which Varro nsterwnrds dedicated ιο ΜῖνιΑ His
complaint that Varro had been writing for two years without mnkiug
any progren¹ shows how little samiliarity there ean have been between
the two‘. Cicero ἠε minded tn> veit sor Varro’s promised gift und then
ιο repay it by a richer present‘⁴ But, apart (rorn these causes sor
gmmhling, Cicero thought the new suggestion ol* Atticus a ⁴ godsend ¹⁹.
Since the De B'nibus was already ‘betrothed’ ιο Brutus ⁷, he promised
to transfer to Vns-ro the Academica, allowing that Catulus and Lucullus,
though of noble hinh, had no claim to be considered learned ⁸. So little
learning did they posse& that they could not even heve dreamed os the
doctrines they had been made iu the first edition of the Academica to
