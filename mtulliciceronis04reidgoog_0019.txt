2 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO<

At this time (Le. before 88 nic.) Cicero also heard the lectures of
Diodotus the stuic, with whom he studied chiefly, though not exclu-
sively. the art or dialectie'. This arty which Cicero deems so imponant
to the orator that he calls it ‘abbreviated eloquence‚¹ was then almost
the monopoly os the Stoic school. For sorne time Cicero spent all his
days with Diodotus in the severest study, but he seems not to have been
much attracted by the general Stoic teaching. still, the friendship
between the two Iasted till the death os Diodotus, who, according to a
sashion set by the Rornan Stoic circle of the time os Scipio and Laelius,
became an inmate os Cicem's house, where he died in nc, 59, leaving
his pupi! heir to a not inconsiderable property'. He seems ιο have
been one of tlte most accomplished men os his time, and Cicero's
feelings towards him were those οἰ gratitude, esteem, and admira-
tion'.

In the year 88 nic. the celebrated Philo of Larissa⁷ then head os the
Academi: School, came to Rome, one of a number os eminent Greeks
who fled from Athens on the approach os its siege during the Mithri-
datie war. Philo, like Diodotus, was a man of versatile genius: unlike
the Stoic philosopher, be was a perfect master os both the theory und
the practice os oratory. Cicero had scarcely heard him before 211
inclinatiora for Epicureanism was swept srorn his mind, and he sur-
rendered himself wholly, as he tells us, to the brilliant Academic‘.
Smitten with a marvellous enthusiasm he abandoned all other studies
sor philosophy⁴ His zeal was quiclrened by the conviction that the
old judicial system of Rome was overthrown sor ever, and that the
great career once open xo an orator was now barred³.

We thus see that before Cicero was twenty years of age, he had
been brought into intimate connexion with at least three os the most
eminent philosophers uf the day, who represented the three most
vigorous and important Greek schools. 1t is sair to conclude that
he must have become thoroughly acquainted with their spirit, and
with the main tenets of each. His own statements, aster every deduc-
tion necessitated by his egokism has been made, leave no doubt about
his diligeuce as a student. In his later works he osten dwells on his
youthsul devotion to philosophy'. It would be unwise to lay too
