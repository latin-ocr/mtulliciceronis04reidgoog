58 THE A cADEMlcs OF CICERO.

jectures on indirect evidence os a very shadowy kind. The theory of
C. F. Hermann, that Philo returned to Plato's doctrine os the ἴδιαι, is
destitute os all probability& &ner thinks that Philo merely restated
with greater emphasis the Carneadem theory os probability! This he
concludes from a passage in the Aeasremisa which may reffer to Philo
especially. though that is far from certain', lt is moreover difficult to
see why Philo should have been described as the founder or one os
the founders os u fourth Amderny (in suecession to the Amdemies os
Plato, Arcesilas and Camudes‘) unless he gave utterance to some
doen-ine which was supposed to he novel. According to Cicero, when
Antiochus first became acquainted with Philo's new views, he con-
fidently appealed to a philosopher well acquaiuted with the history
os the Aademy, to say whether he had ever heard os such doctrines
being preached by any professed adherent of the school'. From
another passage os Cicero it appears that Philo, while he aserted that
the Academia school had been persectly consistent fmm first to last,
from the time of Plato to his own', and while he treated the supposed
contrast between Old and New Academy as a delusion, yet endeavoured
to minimise the effect os the destructive criticism admced by Arcesilas
and Carneades, md so to show that the history os the New Aoedemy
had been generally misunderstood ¹. Hence he was openly charged with
lying, not only by Antiochus, but by Catulus the elder. That the ‘lie'
os Philo, about the nature os which there has been much discussion, must
have consisted in sn attempt to put a new complexim on the scepeia!
teaching of Arcesilas and Carneades, must be clear to any one who
attentively considers the passages in which the 'lie’ is mentionem. In
a.ll probability Philo argued that the solvent analysis which the New
Aademie leaders applied to the Stoic criterion os truth did not express
their own views, but was merely a justifiahle polemical expedient. He
