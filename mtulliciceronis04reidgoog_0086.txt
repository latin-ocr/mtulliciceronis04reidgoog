INTRODUCTION. 69

(Μ), who is now engaged in editing Cicero sor the Teubner series of
texts. 'The net result os my judgment upon the evidence is a text
which lies considerably nearer to the mss than that us all three editors
just mentioned. All of thern¹ as 1 think my notes will show, have
altered many passages unnecessarily. This is chiefly due to the fact
that, good Latinists and critics ns they are. they fail at many points
i'ronx want ot* a special study of the ancient sources for the philosophie
doctrines with which the Academica deals. It is not possible safely to
construet a text sor any one os Cicero's philosophica! writings from a
knowledge os latin alone, and least os all sor the Academica. Is 1 have
been able, asi think 1 have, to correct in a good many passages, on
grounds os Latin criticisrn alone, the jndgments oi¹ these three editors,
the reason is that 1 have known the text oi this book nearly by heart for
many years. and have thus been enabled to bring to henr upon it at
once anything germane to it which has come before me in the oourse of
prolonged reading largely directed ιο this special end

d. 1 now proceed to mention some other matters more or loss
closely connected with the textual enti-:ism os the book.

1. In the library of the University of Cambridge there is a copy
of the edition of Stephanus ο( 1538, 1539, which once belonged to
Ρ. Faber, and has annotations apparently in his handwriting'. Ont of
respect for Faber's name. 1 have gone carefully through them, but find
nothing os any value in them. They as a rule either give the readings
os Lambinus, or references to passages in Greek and Latin authors.
Only in a few instances do these written annotations disagree with those
printed by Faber, and they never add anything os importance.

a. The codices Euenus quoted hy Davies have long been a puzzle
to scholas. For most sacis that are known conceming them Ι may
refer to Pros. J. B. Mayor's introduction to his edition of the De natura
deorum! Davies speaks at different times of three codices Elimas, One
os these seems to have been ι real codex, containing the asculan Dtir·
putatam-r only. The other two vere not properly cadim at all, but two
sets ol* various readings professing (itappears) to be drawn from two uss,
and written in the margin os a copy of Stephanus' Cicero (1538—9).
Of these uss (is they really existed) only one contained the Academica
Pamnbra, while both contained the Lea-ullus. Α mesu! examination
