14 THE ACABEMICS OF CICERO.

an Ecleczic¹. It may be questioned whether the title is suited to any
os the ancient writers on philosophy. At any rate the application os the
nasue to Cicero, without strict limitation and definition, may easily lead,
as it has led, to serious misconeeptions reguding his positionr Many os
the writers who dub Cicero ‘eclectic' appear to think that they thereby
cast on him a grave reproach. The note or mark os eclectieism present
to the minds os these writers is want os originality. Now to charge
Cicero with wantos originality betrays a sailure to catch the spirit os
the age in which he lived. It was an age os exposition and corn-
rnentation, not an age os original thought, and this is just as true of the
Greek world at that period es os the Rornan- No substantially novel
views os philosophy had been propounded since the time ol' Carneades;
indeed we might say since the u'me of Arcesilas. It was tacitly assumed
on all hands that any one who pursued philosophy must needs attach
himself to one of the existing schonls There was absolutely no
demand whatever sor views os truth which prosessed to be new'.
Originality in a philosopher, sar frorn being looked upon as a merit,
would rather have been treated as a sin. ehanges indeed, most pro-
sound and momentous, were in progress- Old dogmas and formulas
were continually on the lips of the philosophus, and old controversia]
hattles were incessantly fought over again, yet the spirit os the com<
batants was vastly different froin that os their intellectual foresathers.
The change however did not prooeed from the speculations oi any in-
dividuals, but was part os a general movement in culture and society.
Further, ια speak os Cicero as an ‘eclectic' is to lead unwan-y
readers to misapprehend, in particular, the standpoint os the New
Acudemy. The eclectio makes it his business to appropriate parts
of different systems, and wenve thern into :t consistent whole. But
the New Academy was bound hy the very condition os its existence to
resrain t'rom inculcating any particular doctrines. Its one sunction was
to breathe into its disciples the spirit ot· criticism, to drive out from
their mir-ds that confident spirit of dogmatic assertion, which like some
νήια and savage monster (so Cicero has it') dominnted the adherents
os all the other philosophies. This task accomplished, the New Am-
demy leit its alumni absolutely free to accept :my tenets whatever.
They were bound to consider all arguments which could he advanced
sor or against all doctrines, and then, striking a balance os probabilities,
