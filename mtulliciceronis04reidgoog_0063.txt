46 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Hortensius, and Cicero had gone over nearly the whole ground marked
out sor the discussion: but only cursor-ily, so that there was plenty os
room sor a more minute examinationi in the Lucullus.

One question remains: how sar did Cicero defend Philo against the
δὲ’-161( os Catulus? Krische (followed by Engsmnd) believes that the
argument of Catulus was snswered point hy point. In this opinion Ι
cannot concur. Cicero never appears elsewhere as the desender of Philo's
reactionary doctrines! Tne exprfflsions of Lucullus seem to imply that
this part os his teaching had been dismissed by all the disputams‘. It
follows that when Cicero, in his letter or dedimtion to Varro, describes
his own part as tha of Philo (partis mihi sumpsi Philonw), he merely
attaches Philo’s name to those general New Academic doctrines which
had been so brilliantly supported by the pupil os Clitomachus in his
earlier days. The two chief sources for Cicero's speech in the Catulus
were, as ve shall see, Philo himself and Clitomachus.

In that intermediae surm os the Academica, where Cato and Brutus
appeared in the place os Hortensius and Lucullus¹ there can be no
doubt that Brutus occupied a more prominent position than Cato.
Consequently Cato must have taken the comparatively inferior pm os
Hortensius, while Brutus took that of Lucullus. It may perhaps seem
strange that a Stoic of the Stoics like Cato should be chosen to repre-
sent Antiochus, however much that philosopher may have hon-owed
from Zeno. The role given to Hortensius, however, was in my view
such as any cultivated man might sustain who had not definitely com-
mitted himself to sceptical principles. So eminent an Antiochenn as
Brutus cannot have been reduced to the compasatively secundm-y posi⁴
tion assigned to Hortensius in the Academica Prior-z. He would natu-
mlly occupy the plnce given ω Varro in the second edition¹. If this be
true, Brutus would not speak at length in the first hals os the work.
Cato is not closely enough connected> with the Academica to render it
necfflary ιο neat os him firi-her.

'nie day aster the discussion nmated in the catulus, during which
Lucullus had been merely a listcner, the whole party left the Cumaean
villa of Catulus early in the morning, and <ame to that os Hortensius
