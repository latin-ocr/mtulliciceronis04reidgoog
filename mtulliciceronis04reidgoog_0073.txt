56 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Pyrrho and Arcesilas had maintained thst all we can do is to act upon'
phenomena without attempn'ng to determine their truth or faisehoom
Carneades, equally holding that certainty is a chimera.. contended that
reason could lead up to sundry approximnfions to certainty, which were
the proper bases for action⁴

The question whether action was possible without certainty was
much talked of by the disputans, but the debate on this topic amounted
in essence to nothing but assertion and denia-l. The dogrnatists affimed
that is the sceptics were consistent they would be reduced to inaction
pt* every description. The dogmatic position rnny be here stated in the
words os Hume'. ‘A Pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy
will have any constant influenoe, or is it had that its influeuce would be
beneficia] ω ςοοίειγ, On the contrary, he must aeknowledge, if he
will admowledge anything. that all hurnan lise must perish, were his
principles univers-slly and stffldily to prevaiL All diseourse, all action
would immediately cease, and men remain in a total lethaxgy, till the
necessities os nature, unsatisfied, put an end to their misemble existence.
12 is true so fatal an event is very little to be druded. Nature is always
too strong for principle, and though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself
and others into a momentary confusion by his profound reasonings, the
first aud most trivial event in lite will put to ssight all his doubts and
scruples ancl leave him the same in every point os action aud specula-
tion with the philosophas os every other sect, or with those who never
concerned themselves with any philosophical arguments or reseasches'

The sceptics on the other hand maintained that there was no
inoonsistency in their zeting and speaking like other rnen, provided it
were understood that their speech or action was not to be taken as
implying a belief in the correctness of impressione They entrenched
themselves in their impregnable posit-ion, which may also be described
by quoting Hume'. ‘By what argument can it be proved that the per-
ceptions os the mind must be caused by external objects entirely differ-
ent from them, though resembling them?w lt is a question os fact
whether the perceptions os the sensa be produced by externa-l objeets
resembling them. How shall this question be determined? By caeperi-
enee surely as all other questions os a like nature. But here experience
is and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to
it but the perceptions and cannot possibly reaeh any experience of their
connexion with objects The supposition of such a connexionis there-
fore without any foundation in reasoning.¹
