INTRODUCTION.

ξ r. Cicero as man os teum and student quhHosophy.

Ιτ would seem tha Cicero's love sor litei-«iture was inherited from his
father, who, being os infirm healtli, lived constant-ly a Arpinum, md
spent the greater part of his time in study'. From him was prohnbly
derived that strong love sor the old Latin cli-amatio and epie poetry
which his son throughout his writings displays. He too, we may con-
jecture, led the young Cicero to feel the imponance os a study of
philosophy to serve a: a corrective for the somewhat nni-tow rhetorical
discipline οἰ the time'.

Cieero's first systemztic lessons in philosophy were given him by the
Epicurean Phaedrus, then az Rome because of the unsetued state os
Athens. nis leonites Cicero attended at uvery early nge, even before he
lind assumed the toga virilis. The pupil seems ιο have been conver-ted
ar once ro the tenets os the master& Phaedrus remaiued to the eud or
his lise n friend of Cicero, who speaks warmly in praise os his tenoher's
amiable disposition and refined style. He is the only Epic-nan, with,
perhaps, the exception os Lucretius, whom the orator ever auom to
possess any litem-y power‘. Cicero soon abandoned Epicureanism,
but his schoolseuow, T. Pomponius Atticus, received more lasting
impressions from the taching oi* Phaedrus. It was probably at this
period us their lives that Atticus and his friend became icquainted
with Patro, who suoceeded Phaedrus ns head os the Epicurean schoo1¹.
