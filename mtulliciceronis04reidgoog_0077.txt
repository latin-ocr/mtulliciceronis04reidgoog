60 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

⁸8 ιε’. The elder Catulus, who is said to have reprehended Philo
for his change os opinion', died a few months later during the proscrip-
tion os Marius and Cinna. lf the statement about Catulus is correct,
an extraordinarily small space os time is lest sor Philo's change ot·
opinion to have become known. Yet that the ‘duo libri' in which
Philo expressed his new views vere composed at last as late as the

a short time before he received them. 11 is possible that. iu the public

the methods they pmsued‘. During all the vigorous and brilliant
period os the New Academy the titula-r sceptical school was in abeyance',
