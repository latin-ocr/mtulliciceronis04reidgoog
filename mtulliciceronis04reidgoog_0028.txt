INTRODUCTIOM 1 1

Greek philosophy were, as Cicero often insisrs, one dialectical, the
establishment of a mirmion. such as would suffice to distinguish the
true from the falsu and one ethical. the determination of the sumn-ium
bonum, or moral standai-01¹. · It iz convenient here to take the dialec-
tie-1 pmblem first (though iri the eyes os the ancients it was infinitely
the less imponant os the two). All that was distinctive os the New
Aoedemy was its dialectic'. lt proclaimed no peculia: views either in
ethies or in physico As the Sceptical school of Pyrrho was practioelly
iu abeyance', the New Academy had sor its own especial property the
doctrine that man is so constituted as to be incnpnble of reaching
absolute and oemin trudit It was by virtue of accepting this tenet
that Cicero became and on all occasions declared himself a sollower os
the New Academy.

It is easy to see what there was in this view to aurant Cicero. His
mind was open and nnprejudiced, receptive :md impressible, to an ex-
naordinary degree, and utterly unfltted for a blind and deas desence os
any fixed dogma* His temperament also was gentle almost to sostness,
and he entirely lacked the robust conf-donce in sels which distinguishes
the dogmatie controversi-inst, His experiente as ain orator also inclined
him towards the Neve Aeaderny. He was accustomed to hear argu>
ments put {orward with equal persuasiveness on both sides os a case.
ln other fields tuo it seemed to him arrogant ιο zdvance any proposi-
tion with a conviction of its absolute, indestructible and irresrugable
nuth. One requisite os a philosophy with him vm that it should
avoid this arrogance‘. Philosophers of the highest repnte sor ability
and sincerity had held the most opposite opinions ou the same sub-
jects'. Το withhold absolute assent from all doctrines, while giving
a qualified assent to those which seemed most pmbable. was tlie only
prudent course'. The diver-sities ο( view which the most famous intel-
lects exhibit, ought, said Cicero, to incline thinkers towards charity and
toleration, and to repel thern from the sury of dogmatism. Men ought to
teaeh and enlighten one another in a spirit uf gentleness and moderatiori ⁸.
