INTRODUCTION 27

in a very imperfectly developed state Contradictions which appear
to a modern render superficial and glaring are passed over without
misgiving by even n Plato or an Aristode. In the sense sor orderly
arrangement and regular development os arguments, and in stringency
in the use ot* technical teri-ns, the whole os the ancient philosophy is
very deficient whenjudged by a modern stzndard¹. Now of all the
Greek systems the wei-st in these respeets was thur with which Cicero
had most to deal, the Stoiv. Itis not too much to say that it was, in
its details, a taugled weh of inconsistencies, even as expounded by its
highest authorities'.

It is very seldoni that we can bring a passage os Cicero sace to ⁷

sace with the Greek passage smm which ir was translated. Diogenes
Laertius, Stobneus, and other writers os their class give us as a rule only
their genem! impressions of the different philosophies, without naming
the portione of the ancient writings from which they drew the irn-
pressions. Opinions are vaguely put down to ‘Chrysippus' or 'the
Stoics: and so on> When assertions os this kind conflict with asser-
tions ascribed to the sai-ne persons by Cicero, scholam have been too
ready to juinp to the conclusion that Cicero has blundered. They
have forgotten that what Chrysippus maintained in one work he denied
in another, :ind that the Stoic system took very different forms in the
mouths os its different exponents. Confirmations of Cicero's accuracy
osten come to light in the most unexpected quarters, and unless n
scholm- can conscientiously‘say that he has examined every ancient
passage which bears upon any point in question, he will be very rash
in pronouncing dogmatimlly that Cicero is in error³. Even where
no confirmation exists elsewhere, ir is always possible and generally
probable that we have some isolated utterance which Cicero alone
has preserved.
