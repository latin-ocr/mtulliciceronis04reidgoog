INTRODUCTIOM 73

possible, tlte loss would be greater than the gain. Α thousand important
lessons in scholarship depend on the determination of the spelling used
at particular epoche :ind by different authors. The subject is however
too large to he pursued heret I would only point out one matter which
seems to me os the highest importance. The study os Latin inscriptions
gains in consequence every year. If the principle were always followed
os representing as nearly as possible the orthography actually employed
by each author, the student who passes from literature to inscriptions
would have as little as possible to unlenrn. At present he must get rid
os a whole vargo os rubbish, which has not any antiquity to recommend
it, since it is a burden sor the most part cast upon scholurship by the
random etymology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries >

In determining matters os spelling even the hest uss are but in-
different guides. Cicero who, as Quintilian tells us', was most punc-

·tilious in his attention to orthography, would be aghast at Halm’s text
os the Lucullus produced by adher-enee to the Leyden and Vienna uss&
The testimony os inscriptions, und os ancient writers who have touched
on orthography, used us it has been used by Corssen, Fleckeisen, Bram-
bach and others. is vastly more valuable. Yet the confrrmatory evidence
os our uss is osten os considerable importance. For example, the
odious quum, to which many English scholars cling with such fondness,
is of the rarest possible occurrence even iri the most corrupt of uss. Α
student might work at uss sor years without coming across a single
instance To take another example, the mss os Cicero, rightly con-
sidered. give strong support to the conclusion which is arrived ut on
other grounds, that this author used -i only, not -ῐί, in the genitive
singular os nouns whose nominatives end in -ius or -iunn In the ages
when the scribes wrote the employmeut οἱ -ii was universal, and the
temptation to change the -i into -ii was therefore intensely strong. Yet
some οἱ our iuss preserve the original t'orm in as many cases as one in
five, a fact utterly incapnble or explanation on the supposition that the
form used hy Cicero was that in -ii-

I have been at pains to point out here and there in my notes the
true value os the conclusions to be drawn from uss in matters os spell-
ing, because it hus rarely as yet been duly appreciated. It is perhaps
hardly necessary to warn readers that rny orthography does not pretend
to be certain or final. lt only represents the best results my studies
have enabled me to attain.
