54 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

way the mode in which the ancients stated the problema, and the lines
on which they proceeded in search of irs solution.

From the earliest appearance os rhe term ἐπιστήμη in Greek specu-
latiora, it carried with it the idea os fixlry and indestructibility. 'l’o the
Greek mind, knowledge was 'something which did not admit os degree.
Α great part os the work done by the predecessors os Plato had sor its
result the demonstr-arion that knowledge in the Greek signifimtion os
the ter-m could not he based solely on the infor-marion supplied by the
senses. By their attacks on the trustwonhiness os rhe peroeptions of
the senses, the Physicisrs and Eleates and Plato himself stored up
results which formed in later times half the mochin-trade of lhe
Seepties and New Aendernics. But all these earlier schools, and Aristotle
after thern, held that the inxellecr was capable or purging the impressions
os sense from their impurities, and os arr-iving at certain and irresmgable
mir-h.

On the other hand the critical efforts os the Sophiste, the Megarians
the Eristics, and even the Cyrenaioe', tended to prove that the intellect
could supply no sounder or surer foundation sor knowledge than the
senses It remained sor Pyr-rho of Elis to combine in one compre-
hensive and orderly scheme the somewhat confused eririeism os the
earlier nnd the later schools, and to boldly pronounce that no such thing
as ἐπιστήμη, knowledge, is anainable by human sacnlties. but that we
must net upon φωνόμνιι, which give a confused and salse picture os the
realities lying behind rhem

Nothing in the whole history of philosophy is more striking than the
small vitality which the theories os knowledge eonstnrcted by Plato and
Aristode possessed in ancient times Other parts of their systems con-
tinued to exert influence, bur the sublime theory os ideas us coueeived
by Plato, and the elaborate sibi-ic of human knowledge as reared by
Aristotle, became practically obsolete wirhin a generatiou or two of the
dezth os their authors* Aster the time os Zeno nearly all who main-
tained that eertitude was within human reach appealed to the theory
which he ndvanced. From this tirne sorwnrd all the disputante in the
debete meidy assumed that, is knowledge is to be found anywhere. ir
can be found only in experience Nothing at all like the modern idea
οἱ ‘intuition' was reeognised as a possible source of knowledge- Again,
none os rhe disput-ants questioned the existence os a real world of
things lying behind the phenornena os which we are conscious'. These
