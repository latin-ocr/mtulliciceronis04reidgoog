the thjopict, De Officiis and Tusculan Dsspmotions. Mr Bradshaw tells
me that from the writing and ornamenmnon he would have concluded
that the ias was probably written in the north of Holland. At the eud
is this sigmture: ‘per mama· neodoriei Nyeolai Werken de Abbenbmeck
liber explicit anna dommi 1444! The writer was therefore evidently u
Hollander, but he probably wrote in Englzud. There are many beautiful
illuminations remaining, and many more liave been cut out⁴ Mr Brad-
shaw has shown me that the m's was the gift os Arehbishop Rotherharn
ιο the Libram, where it has remained for just upon four centuries.

On ilie margin are many notes ascribed to William of Malmesbury,
nearly all written in the first person, in such a way as to show that this MS
is to be traced back ια one actually annotared by Williarn himself. The
notes consixt not only of summaries os the iuguments in the text, but of
numerous parallel passages frorn Cicero himself, and quotations from or
references to a great number of authors, among whom rnay be mentioned
particularly Augustlne, Lactantius, Orosius, Iustinus. Valerius Maximus,
Florus, Pliny the elder, Lucan, Macrobius. Jerome, the periochae of
Livy. These annot-ulons really show very considerable reading and
researcb. William seems to have been especially inter-ested in gathering
together fragments of lost works by Cicero, out of the eoelesiastical
writers. The follou'ring extracts from notes appended to the Lucullus,
are of interest. Alter quoting from the outset o( the Dc diurnatione
u passage relating to the four books or the Amdemhta Posteriora, und
further from Augustine two passages conoeming Varro, viz. the fragment
numbered 36 in my edition, and part os 159, william says ‘hic liber
primus Achademicorum in Angla uon invenitur, sed nte secundus in qua
Catulus pra Achademicis din-putans introducitur, sicut ex multis quae in

, not acquainted with the letters of Cicero which disclose the secret of the
two editions, he had apprehended the divisions os the subject-matter
better than many recent scholars. He goes on thus: ‘dim idm Cicero
