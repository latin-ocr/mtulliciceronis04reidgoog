48 7⁸1!ss ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

when he went to Asia was the poet Archias, and during the whole os
his residente in the Fast he sought to attach learned rnen to his person
At Aleundria he was found in the company os Antiochus, Aristus,
Heraclitus Tyrius, Tetrilius Rogus and the Selii, all men ot philosqwhic
usres'. He is several times mentioned by Pliny in the Naturalliistmy
as the patron of Greek artists. Yet, as we have already seen, Cicero
aelrnowledged in his letters to Atticus that Lucullus was no philosopher.
He has to be propped up, like Can-lus, by the suthority os another
person* All his arguments :ire explicitly stated to be derived from a
discussion in which he had heard Antiochus engage. The speech oi
Lucullus vus, as 1 have said, mainly a reply to that os Cicero in the
Catulus. Any closer examination os its contents must be postponed till
1 come to annotat its actual text The same may be said of Cicero'n
answer.

Iu the inter-mediate form os the Academica, the speech os Lucullus

connexion with the work, 1 do not think it necessary to do rnuch more
than mll attention to the fact. 1 may, however, notice the clooe rela-
tionship in which Brutus stood to the other persons with whom we have
had ιο deaL He was nephev of Cato, whose halfisister Servilia was
wife os Lucullus& Caio was tutor to Lucullus¹ sou⁷ with Cicero sora
sort os adviser: while Hortensius had married a divorced wife os Cato.
All of them were os the Senatorial party, and Cato and Brutus lived to
be present, with Cicero, during the was between Pompey und Caesar.
Brutus and Cicero were both friends of Antiochus md Aristus, whose
pupil Brutus was'.

When Cicero dedicated the Academica to Varro, very slight altera-
tions were necessary in the sceuery and other accessories os the piece.
Cicero had a villa close to the Cumaean villa os Catulus and almost within
sight of Hortensius' villu at Bauli( Vama’s villa.. at which the scene
was now laid, was close to the Luci-ine lnke'. With regard ω the
reigned date of the discor-nse, we may observe that at the very outset os
