THE ACADEMICS OF CICERol

Oratore, where Cicero speaks of the combined Academia and Peri-
μων-ἑο schools under that name'. It may be with reference Ιο the
Academia among other worlrs that in n later letter he expresses hirn-
self satisfieri with the progress he has luade in his litem-y undertak-
ings‘. During the remainder of his sojoum nt Astura he oontinued to
be actively employed, but though he speaks of some other lizerary
projecte, we find no express mention in his letters to Atticus of the
Amdemim. A few days before leaving Astura he declared that however
much his detractors might reproach him with inactiun, they could not
read the numerous works orl which he had been engaged, within the
same time that he had taken to compose then-1¹.

On the r4lh May', Cicero len Astura for Tusculum, which he
reached on the following day, having spent a night at Lanuvium. lt
had eost him a great effort to make up his rnind to seek again the house
where Tullia had die-1⁷. The day before he lefr Astura, Cicero infonned
Atticus that he had finished (⁸ absolui‘) duo magna owniypmm'. These
words have caused rnnch differente of opinion among scholam Madvig·
(following rnany earlier writers) interprete the words to refer to the
Academica and the Dc Finibus. But insuperable obstacles stand in the
way of this opinion ¹¹¹. Nothing can be more cerlzlin than that the De
Finibus was still in an incomplete condition when Cicero left Astura'¹.
