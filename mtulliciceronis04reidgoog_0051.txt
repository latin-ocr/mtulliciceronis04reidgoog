of Antiochus md the fines« person to expound the opinions os that
philosopher& It happened that continual rain fell during the first few
days os Cieero's stay at Arpinum, so he employed his whole time in
editing :fresh the Amdemzea, which he now divided into four books
instead os two, making the interlocutum himself, Varro and Atticus'.
The position occupied hy Atticus in the dialogue was quite second<
ary. but he was so weil pleased with it that Cicero determined ιο

made by Atticus that Cotta should also be introduced was rejected

pushed on, Cicero had frequent doubs about {he expediency os dedi-
cating the work to Varro. He repeatedly throws upon Atticus the
whole responsihility sor the decision, and but for his friend's impor-
tnnities he would probably again have changed his pians. Nearly every
letter written to Atticus during the progress os the work contains en-
aazia that he would consider the matter over and over again before he
finally deeided'. As no reasons had been given sor these solicita-
tiens, Atticus natumliy grew impatient, and Cicero was obliged ίο
assurt him that there were reasons, which he would disaelose when
they met'. The true reasons did however appear in some later letters.
