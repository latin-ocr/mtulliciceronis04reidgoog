INTRODUCTJOM 5 7

Hume and many other writers since have pronounced these soeptinnl
urguments to he unanswerahle. Modern philosopher-s have in snt been
able'to supply ιο the question ‘why should we believe any impressiqn
of sense to give a toi-rect picture os the object which causes it?¹ no
better answer than that os the scoies ‘because in some msa οω- minda
feel convinced os the correctness of the impression, in others not!

b. Phua and Antiochus.

The opinions of these philosophers will only here be discussed so
taras they concern the main problern os the Academisak Both Philo
and Antiochus began their taching as ardent desendet-³ os the pure
doen-ine os Carneades'. Both in their later days promoted, in different
degrees, a reaction towards dogmatic doctrines ln stre case os Ando-
chus this reaction was complete. So sar ns dialeerie was concemed, he
wholly attached himself to the sxoic school. In ethics and natural
science he also accepted much from Zeno and Chrysippus, while de-
clas-ing that these philosophas had bonowed their taching from Plato
and Anstotle and their immediate souoweusx In Philo's case the nature os
the κατίοι-ι is exceedingly difficult tu traee All the information about
it which we possess cousins os a few hints in the Academica and two or
three passages in other writers Philo it is certain ut au times main-
tained in ivs full force the whole polemi: conducted by Carneades
against the Stoie definitior· os the ‘irresistible impressionfl' Yet he
contended thar things are in their own nature knowable‘. But none ol*
the sceptioe or New Amdemioe hatl ever asserted that our laek us sure
knowledge is due to «he nat-ure os the objecrs of cognition. They re-
ferred it entirely to the desects in nur saculries os perception. We want

us any infor-marion on this point. md we are reduced to founding con-
