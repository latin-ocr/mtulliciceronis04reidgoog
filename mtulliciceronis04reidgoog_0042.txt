elaims as his own is the style in which they are rendered- Such
additions as he made to the originals were prescribed by two require-
ments, first the form into which the works were thrown—always that os
the dialogue—secondly, the interesrs os Roman readers for whom
episotles and illusa-anons from the history and literature os their own
country were introduced„ To speak οἱ the latter class os additions first,
it must be remembered thar. iu the eyes of the average Roman. philo-
sophy in itself lacked dignus, and could only be attractive when set in
a Roman sume.

Au Cicero⁷s philosophia! works are written iu the sonu os dia-
logues; hut the diangue was os the later Greek type, and not ol* the
kind with which we are so familiar from the worlrs os Plato. This form
seems to have died with Plato. The later form was much less dra-
matie. contained much less os question and auswer and os repartee, and
much more os continuous expo-itinn. The conversation between the
characters was confined to a few episodes, and the various conflicting
views os the subject discussed were delivered in unintermpted, or
scarcely inter-rupted speeches os considerable length'.

Cicero himself mentions two styles os dialogue which he followed,
that os Heraclides, who introduced as dramatis personae famous rnen
of a bygone time, and that os Aristone, who always appeared himself
as nn interlocutor in his dialogues, und played the leading part& He
mentions the Dc ne publica as Heraclidem, aud to the same class
belong the laelius and the Cato Maior. As Aristotelian he mentions
the works he was engaged upon in or about the year 45 n‚c.⁴‚ mean-
ing the Academia and Dt R'nibus, and probably the Hortensium
though to the same category belong all Cicero's din-logues, with the
exception of the three mentioned above, and perhaps the De Oratore.
