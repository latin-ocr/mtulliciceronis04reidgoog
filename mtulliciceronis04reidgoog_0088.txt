INTRODUCTION. 71

The next editor who did much to advance the criticism os the
Academica was John Davies, Prfflident οἱ Queens' College, Cambridge,
as a Latin scholar surpassed in his own time by Bentley alone. His
first edition appeared in 1725, his second in 1736 ; the latter has been
reprinted by Rath (Halle, 180⁶). Davies successfully studied in other
ancient works the philosophieal doctrines discussed in the Academica.
The value os his work, great in itsels, was enhaneed by reprints of *the
notes os Victorius, Muretus, Lambinus, Faber and Turnebus, and other
scholam ’

An edition by Wetzel (Brunswiek, ¹7⁹⁹) contains sevr notes, but
they are generally sensible Tha« by Hiilsemaun (Magdeburg 1806)
has a good deal of usesul illustrative matter.

It is unsonunntely necessary to mention the edition of Goerenz
(Leipzig, 1810). Tlie extraordinary vitality οἱ this writers works is a
singular fact in litemry history. Before ¹82⁶ Goerenz had a reputatio!-
sor Latin scholarship which was perhaps not inferior to that 01 any. man
then living. 1n that year, however, a small work· was published by
Madvig, then barely twenty-one years of age, which shattered sor ever
the pretensions of Goerenz to the title of scholar, in the eyes at leiust os
211 those who are qualified and who take pains enough to judge. Yet
a year later Orelli could found his text os the Academica upon the
‘praestantissima mamb* os Goerenz, though he wns well acquainted
with Madvig's little book. Since then Madvig, in his editions of the
De finibus, has most rnercilessly displayed Goerenz as the ‹lrunken
Helo: os Latin scholarship. ln spite os this, the professed guides or
studious youth, occasionally in Germany, but more osten in England,
still to this day reeommend the editions os Goerenr, even to the ex-
clusion os all others.

The recension ol* Goereuz was the last which appeared, accompanied
by explanatory notes, until my first edition of 1874.

Orelli⁷s antimi edition (zurich, 18²7) is still so uset'ul, that it deserves
ι mention. It gives the readings of many os the earlier editions, and
although these are not always accurately reported, the informationi is
very acceptable, when necess cannot be had to an extensive libras-y.
Orelli hav also reprinted, among uther things, the Academica os P.
Valentia (mentioned below), and the work σί Augustine, Adzoersus
Academicos.

The most valuble translations are those os Boost (Mannheim, 1816)
who was in many passages the first writer to see the true interpretation,
