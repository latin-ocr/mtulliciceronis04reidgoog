²0 THE A CADEMJCS OF CICERO.

ὁ ³· On the aim qs Cicero in wn'eing his philmpkisal marks, and
their character.

In the preceding sections some idea hus been conveyed os the
intelle-:mal atmosphere in which Cicero lived, and the opinions con-
cerning philosophy which he adopted. Fur the right appreciation of
his philosophical works, one thing more is wanted, a clear notion os
