32 THE Α CADEMJCS OF CICERO.

The discussion in the Acaekmiaz Priora is carried on at the villa os
Hortensius near Bauli; in the maenum ut the villa os Lucullus near
Cumae 1t is rather surprising thnt under these circumstances there
should be only oue direct reference to the Hortensius in the Lucullus.
The Academica in its original sonn was no doubt sent ω Atticus
very soon aster Cicero reached Tusculum ¹. Probably Atticus, who
visited Cicero at Tusculum, made some objections to the way in which
Cicero had put learned arguments into the mouths os unlmrned ιϊιειιΙ ;
so Cicero took the book back and added ω each division of it a new
introduction. returning the hook sor Atticus‘ appruval ⁸. In all proba-
bility the extant prooemium of the Lucullus is the one which Cioero
rhen affixed. These prooemia constituted a deliberate attempt on the
prist of Cicero to impose upon his readers ι set os statements concern*-
ing the intellectual ability and culture os Catulus and Lucullus which he
knew and in his own letters to Atticus admitted to be salse‘. 1 rnzy
note, as os soi-ue interest in connexion with the Amdemiea, that among
, the unpleasant visits received by Cicero at Tusculum was one from
Vana& ”
On the nst June, Cicero lest Tusculum for Arpinum, in order,
he says, to arrange some business connected with property there, and
also to relieve Brutus from the hurden which his assiduous attentioris
imposed on him'. 'Cicero seems to have been still unsatisfied with his
choico of interlocutors sor the Academias, md the first thing he did on
his arrival was to transfer the parts os Lucullus and Hortensius to Cato
and Brutus; the part of Catulus he probably added to his own'. This
plan vva-s speedily cast asida οιι the arrival of n letter from Atticus,
strongly urging that the whole work should be dedicated ro Varro, or il*
