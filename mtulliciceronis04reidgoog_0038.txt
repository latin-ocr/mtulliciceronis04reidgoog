INTRODUCTION. 2 ι

Such philosophica-l literature ns existed in Iatin when Cicero began
to write wns almost entirely Epicurean, and that too (putting Lucetius
aside) οῖ n very miserable character. C. Amafinius, mentioned in the
Amdmica', was the first ιο write, and his books seem to have had
an enormous circulation'. He found n host os imitator-s, who obtained
such a savoumble receptior: that. in Cioero‘s strong language, they took
possession os the whole os Italy'⁴ Α certain Rabirius and one Catius
an lusum-ian, of whom scarcely anything is known but their names.
were two οἱ the most noted oi these writerst Cicero assigns various
reasons sor their extreme popularity: the easy nature osthe Epicurean
physic-‘3 the fact that there was no other philosophy sor Latin readers,
and the voluptuous blandishments os pleasure when proposed as an
ethim] end. This last cause, as in one passage he seems to allow,
must have been ot· small importante. It is not u little remarkable that
the whole os the Roman Epicurean literature was almost exclusively
devoted to the physical side os the system¹. The Romans had us yet
a strong practiml basis sor morality in the legal and social constitution
os the family, and in their politica! lise, and did not feel the need
of theoretica] systems, though the extinction os liberty was soon to
produce the same effect it had occasioned in Greece. On the other hand
the geneal decay among the educated classes of a belief in the super-
natural⁷ accompmied as it was by nn increase of superstition among
the masses, caused many readers to turn with nvidity to a philosophy
which offered a purely mechanica explanation os the universe.

These Roman Epicur-cans are continuany reproached by Cicero
with their uncouth style os writing'. They are bad translatum οἱ bad

well believe that the reports he followed were true. A curious question
here ansis, how it was that Cicero, in spen-king os the Roman Epicurean
literature, never mentioned Lucretius Probably at this time the poenas
of Lucretius had not yet made their way, aud Cicero, unable to include
the great poet in uis sweeping condemnation, and unwilling to allow
that anything good could corne from the school os Epicurus, preferred
