INTRODUCTIOM 45

Old. and also, in its views regan-ling the foundations ol· knowledge, with
those ancient philosopher-s who preceded Plato. Lucullus, therefore,
reproves hin-r as a rebel iu philosophy, who appeals to great and ancient
names like a seditious tribune'. Unsair use had been made, according
to Lucullus, os Empedocles. Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides.
Xenophznes, Plato, and Soet-ates'. But Cicero did not merely give a
historica! summai-y. He must have dealt with the theory ol· umm-
ληπικὴ mma and ἶννοιιιι (which though really Stoic had been
adopted hy Antiochus), since he found it necessary to ‘manusueture'
(fabr-isan) Latin tenus to represent the Greek’. He probably also
commented on the headlong mshness with which ὼε dogmntists gave
their assent to the (ruth os phenomena. To this a retort is made by
Lucullus⁴. That Cicero's criticism os the dogmaiic schools was, in this
speech, incomplete and merely prelimiuary, may be seen by the fact that

he found no occasion to Latinise such tei-ms as κατάληψις (ἱε. ἰιι rhe .

abstract. as opposed to the individual mmm-neo) φαντασία), ἄνᾶργεια,
ὅρμή, ἀποδείξω, δόγμα, οἰκεῖον, ἄδηλα, ἐποχή, nearly all imponant lenm
in the Stoie, and to some extent in the Antiochean system, all of
which Lucullus is obliged to translate sor himself. The more the
matter is examined the ruore clearly does it uppem that the main
purpose os Cicero in this speech was to justil'y from the history os
philosophy the position of the New Acaderny, and not to advance
soeptioel arguments ngainst experienee, which were reserved sor his
mswer ιο Lucullis. ln the later speech, he expressly tells us thar such
:capti-:al paradoxes as were put sorwaxd by him in the first day’s dis-
course were really out of place, and were merely introduced in order to
disan-n Lucullus, who was n> speak ηεκϋ. Yet these arguments must
hzve occupied sol-ne considerable space in Cicero's speech, although
foreign ω its main intention'. He probably gave a summary classifien-
tion of the sensations, with the reasons sor refusing to assent to the truth
os each class'. The whole constitution and tenor of the elaborate
spetdx os Cicero in the Lucullus proves that no general or minute
demonstrationi os the impossibility os ἐπιστήμη in the dogmatic sense
lud been attempted in his statement os the day before. Cicero's argu-
ment in the Catulus ηις allowed by Lucullus to have oomidmbly
‹lamaged the muse os Antiochus'. The duee speeehes os Catulus,
