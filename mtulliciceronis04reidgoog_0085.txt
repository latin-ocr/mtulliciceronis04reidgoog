68 THE ACADEMJCS OF CICERO.

vilt'ptndi! divinas smpturas gravit& et penaliter peccat, unde c! beatus
ieronimus se caslssatmn et metum pmfiletur in libro ad Eustochium de
divinitate servanda. Qui vera eos ideo legit ut si qum amate et eloquenter
dieunt ipse in suis smptis addit (sic) [here something has evidently
dropped out] et sanctorum elus gloriam opmune tram-serat temes (sic)

magnum urbis ramae legalur! Tben follows the well-known passage
from the third book os Augustine's Consessions, which tells how he
attributed his conversim to the reading of Cicero's Istn‘ensius. This
is suceeeded by the fragment os the Hcrtensius numbered 50 in
C⁴ F. w. Mffller's edition, quoted stom Augustine's De tnhitate.

The orthogmphy of the us is in many respects good. 'l'he spelling
of Greek names in particularis better than in mos« uss.

Os these nine uss, I have collated 7, 8, 9 myselll The readings os
6 are taken stom the Oxsord edition of ¹7⁸35 those os the rest from
Halm.

lt inas been supposed by many scholars that all existing mss of the
De natura deorum, De diuinatione, Rmams, De fila, Topica, Paradoxa,
Lucullus and De legibus ase traoeahle to a single original. The evidence
offered sor this conclusion does not satissy me, but it would be out os
phee to discuss it here. C. F. W- Miiller has elabomtely examined
(Neue Ialtrbia‘cha, ι8641 pp. ιη εεμ 26¹ sq) the relation of the uss
above marked ABV to the archetype, but his conclusions ase os little
value sor the study of the text os the Academica. Miiller attributes
imporunce to a us os the xth cent- at Munich, which still (so [ar as 1
know) remains uncollated

e. ln addition to the rendiugs os the uss described above, Ι have
osten quoted those of the Roman printed edition uf ¹47¹ which repre-
sents, in the Academica Posteriora, n some-what different recension os the
text stom that contained in our uss. The readings ot this edition ere
marked r. Further, 1 have given in all important cases the readings
adopted by three recent editors. whose opinion on all matters connected
with Ciceronian criticism is entitled to a respect-sul hear-ingl These
are Halm (H in the critical notes), Baiter (Β) who pubfished iu 18⁶3
along with Kayser a complete text os Cicero, and C. F. W. Mffller
