8 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

sar the greatest, Cicero said, of all the Peripatetics he had himself
heard and indeed equal in merit to the most eminent os that school&

The mre of that disordered province Cilicia was enough to employ
Cicero¹s thoughts till the end os 5ο. Yet he yenmed for Athens and
philosophy. He wished to leave some memorial os himself at the
beautiful city, and anxiously asked Atticus whether it would look
soolish to build u πρόπυλυν st the Academia. as Appius, his predecessor,
had done at Elemis'. lt seems the Atheuinus os the time were in the
habit. os adapting their ancient statum to suit the noble Romans os
the day, ancl os placing on them sulsome inscriptions. Os this practice
Cicero speaks with loathing. Iu one letter of this date he casei'ully
discusses the errors Atticus had pointed out in the books De n
publica& His wishes with regu-td to Athens still kept their hold upon
his mind, and oh his way horne from Cilicia he spoke os consen-ring
on the city some signal favour⁴. Cicero was anxious to show Rhodes,
with its school os eloquence, to the two boys Marcus and Quintus,
who necompanied him, and they probably touched there sor a few
days'. From thence they went to Athens, where Cicero again stayed
with Aristus', and renewed his friendship with other philosophas,
nmong them Xeno the friend uf Atticus⁷.

On Cicero's return ιο Italy public affairs were in a very critical
condition, ancl lest little roorn fot thoughts about literature. The
letters which belong to this tii-ne ure very pathetien Cicero several
times conti-asts the stat-sinen ot the time with the Scipio he had h‘uu-
self drawn in the De η publia-21¹3 when he thinks os Caesar, Plato's
description of the tyrnnt is present to his mind’ ; when he deliberates
about the course he is himself to take, he naturally recalls the example os
Socrates, who refused ιο leave Athens amid the mismle os the thirty
tyrants¹'. It is curious to find Cicero, in the very midst os civil war,
poring over the books of Demetrius the Magnesia: conoeming concord ¹¹ ς
or employing his days in nrguing with himself a string os abstract
philosophica-l propositions about tyranny ¹¹. Nothing could more clearly

⁴ show that he was really a man of books 3 by nothing but accident
