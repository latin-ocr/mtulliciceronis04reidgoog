old editions the Lamnus is marked throughout as Atudaem'aorum liber IV.
This is an entire mistake, which arose srom a wrong view os Nonius’
quominus, which are always froin the second edition, and can tell us
nothing about the constitution of the first. One other thing is worth
remark. Halm (as many before him had done) places the Academica
Priora before the Posteriora. This seems to me an unmtural arrange-
ment ς the subject-matter of the second edition is certainly prior,
logimlly, to that of the Lucullus.

55. On [he Greek ,νοννιη- ‘y‘ the ‘Academicafl

It lias been sured above (p. ²4) that the philosophica-l worlrs os
Cicero were merely transcripts from the most approved Greek writings
ou the subjects with which they deal. There is but little difficulty in
detenuining the Greek materials which were used in the construction os
the Acadmisu. The arguments in favour of dogmatisrn are frequently

statement os Antiochus' system, is clem· from the close verba-1 agreement
of Varro's speech with other passages iu Cicero professedly drawn from
Antiochus, and also with the Antiochean fragments of Varro preserved
by Augustine'.

In the Academica Priffra Lucullus repr->duces the critidsms os An·
