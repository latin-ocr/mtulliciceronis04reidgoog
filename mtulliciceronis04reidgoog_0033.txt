1 6 THE A CADEMICS OF CICERO.

as expounded by Antiochus'. As Cicero is on the very point os
attacking the Antioc-hun dialectie, his npproval mn only be intended
to refer to the ethical and physiml sides os Antiochus’ system. As the
dury of doubt and the theory οἱ probability had unt been set forth
in any work, either Greek or Roman, sor thirty or sorty years,
Cioem's advoc-cy ol* the Philonian dialectie might well appear to
Varro as an act os desertionz It must aleo be remembered, whenever
Cicero speaks os the 'uetus Academias that he dissented entirely {rom
that estimate os Plato's early sucoessors, for which Antiochus contendent
and maintained that from Socrates ιο Philo uo Academic tencher had
been a dogmatist, w that to speak of m Old and a New Acaderny was
a misralre‘. r

We czn now pass to Cicero’s view os the ethioel problem. The
determination os au ethiml standard was in the eyes of the post—Aristo-
telian philosophus the grand purpose, end and aim οἱ philosophy,
which was emphaticauy defined as ‘the art os conduct’ or ‘the art
os living* (ars uiuendi‘). All speculative and non-ethica] doctrines
were merely estimable as supplying a basis on which this practica! art
could be reared. This is equully true of Pyrrho's seepticism and os
the dogmatism os Zeno and Epicurus, Is the dogmatists objected to
the dialectie os the New Academy, it was only because in their opinion
it logimlly led to the subversion of morulity'. Cicero is therefore
greatly concerned in the Lucullus to prove (hut probability is suf-
ficient to afford that stable basis sor moral practice which he felt ιο be
necessary. The New Academics generally took firmer ground in ethieal
matters than the Sceptics', and Cicero often went beyond his own friends
iu this respect Thus in the De Legibus, when the conversation
turns on n question in momls, he begs the New Academy, which has
introduced confusion into these subjeets, to be silent'. There cau be
no doubt that Cicero was deeply influenced throughout his life by
the scheme os ethim which he had learned from Antiochus In all
Cicero¹s works which touch on moral or politia-³1 questions that philo-
sopher is mentioned wilh great respect'. But nll systems which see-ned
