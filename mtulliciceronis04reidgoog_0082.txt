In my critiml notes 1 have given all the readings o( these twelve uss
which are os any importance, The first eight Ι have collated myself.
For the readings os U Ι have had to depend on the collation given by
the Oxsord editors of ¹783, although 1 have found the infor-rnation they
give about E and ψ so untrustworthy that 1 can put little saith in their
repert of U, The readings os G P V Ι have taken from Halm'.

Os these uss uo one, in my opinion, stands out ns conspicuously
better than the rest. Halm, and aster him Baiter, and to a still greater
degree C. F. W. Miiller, have attributed much importunae ω the ’Μία
Gaianmsir! I believe Iltave rnade it clear in rny critical notes that
this us is largely interpolated and corrected by its copyist, who was
undoubtedly a good scholar. lt may be affinned with confidenee that
all existiug uss os Ama'emica I are ultimately derived from a single
archetype. This archetype was, as Ι conjecture, not very much older
than it: descendants, and was probably Italian by origin. The follow-
ing passages, where all known tiss agree, will be found to support these
conclusions³.
