of the new seeptie school is sumi-ned up in the extant writings os Sextus
Empiricus, who lived in the third century os our era‘. As the later
sceptics made sun use of the literature os the New Academy, Sextus is
of prime importance sor the elucidation os the Academica. He was an
admitted master os the sceptieal philosophy, and his exposition os it is
thorough and relentless- It will be os use to set side by side the com-
paratively loose nssault made hy Clitomachus upon the dogmatists, and
the sar more highly organised attack which we fiqd in Sextus. For
this purpose, we will first take the ten ‘methods’ os Aenesidemus, and
show to what extent they have their counterparts in the Academica.

The first ‘method'’ shows that as animals are differently constituted
the impressimus which objects make on their senses must be different,
and therefore the evidence of sense is contradictory. This is only just
touched upon in the Academica'. Next comes the ‘method' which is
based on the differenees οἱ constitution found among human beings, in
respect both of the hodiiy und ot* the inteilectual powers‘. Under this
head falls that discordance os opinion among the dogmatists which has
supplied so many weapons sor the sceptic armoury in ali ages, Α large
portion os the Academica is devoted to this subject', while a few argu-
ments are also based on the physical diversities existing among men‘.
Thirdly, the sceptic urged that most objects make separate and even
maadietory impressions on two or more of the senses; it is impossible
to say whether the object is possessed of one quality only, which is
differentiated by our senses, or whether it pogesses just so many quali-
ties as our senses perceive. or whether it has other qualities which we
could not perceive without the addition os other senses'. In the Am-
demita these arguments are only just hinted'. The fourth τρόπος is
derived from the differente os impression which the same object makes
on the senses under different hodily conditior-is, for example, in sickness
and in health', This point is urged at sume length in the portion os
the Academua which we possess, and probably had some space devoted
to it in the part which has been lost '·. The fifth ¹method¹ mrries the
