to adopt those views which appeared to have the advantage. But any
utterance os the New Academic was to be taken merely as expressing his
estimare os the probahilities at the moment. Is his estimate changedr
he not only might but must change his doctrine. There was indeed
nothing in the principles os the New Academy to prevent one os its
follow-ers from accepting the Stoic scheme, or the Epicurean scheme
whole and entire, is he could conscientiously say that he had rnade
a thorough examination, and was merely giving expression to what he
supposed at the moment to be probably true⁴ As a matter of sacr,
tradition in a large measure influenced the New Academia in the

' acceptante and rejection or doctrines> But there was nothinglthat
could fairly be described as a New Academic system For example.

We must now turn to another point. lt has been supposed by
many scholars, on the strength of certain passages in the Academica
Posteriora, that Cicero had sor a time abandoned the views he learned
srorn Philo. and resumed them just before the Academica was written.
1n§ ¹³ Varro charges Cicero with deserting the Old Aoedemy sor the
Neu-,and Cicero seerns to admit the charge. But one os the phrases
used by Varro (tractari autem nouam) points to a solution os the
difficulty. Varro evidently rneans that Cicero, having in earlier works
copied the writings os ‘Old Academic’ philosophers, is about to draw
on the titemry stores ot· the Neve Academy. tn composing the Re-
public, De Laegibus, Consulum, Hortensius and other works, he had
used writings which were in the phraseology of the day all classed
as ‘Old Academia* a term under which the earlier Peripatetic and
Amdemic literature was ranked, along with the soidisant ‘Old Aca-
demic' treatises os Antiochus. As the works just mentioned were
entirely ethieal or politica! in their bearing. the use ot* them involved no
abandournent os the one thing needsul for thesollower os the New
Araden-ny. the Carneadem dialectic. That a modified acquiescet-tce in the
ethica! opinions os Antiochus was, in Cicero's view, quite compatible with
the spirit of critical inquiry which he had learned from Philo. is shown
by another passage in the Academica Posteriora (ξ 7), which has caused
much unnecefflry trouble to the commentatas. Cicero there states
that he, in common with Varro, regards with flavour (¹prabamus’) the
'uetus Academia: which the context shows to he the 'uetus Academia’
