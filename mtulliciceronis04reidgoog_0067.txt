50 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Cicero. The negotiations between Atticus md Cicero with mpecl
to the dedication os the second edition, as detailed ssrendy, prove
sufficiently that this slight inem-se in wrdiality did not lead to
friendshsp'.

The philosophiml views os Varro mn be gathmd with tolerable
aceumcy from Augustine, who quotes considerably from the work os
Varro De Philan-ophini Beyond doubt he was a follower os Antiochus
und the socalled Old Acmclemy⁴ How, by nn elabente and peda-utic
process of exluusrion, he selected this school from among the 2⁸8
philosophias which he considered possible, moy be :aad by the curious
in Augustine. My notes on the Academica Foster-ism will show that
there is no reason sor aceusing Cicero os having mista-ken Van-0¹³
philosophicul views This sup-position owes its cun-ency to K O.
Miiller, who, stom Stoic phrases in the De lingua Latina, onneluded
that Varro had passed over to the Stoics before that work was written.
All that was Stoic in Van-o cume from Antiochus·⁴

The exact specification of the changes in the nrmngeoenent os the
subject-matter, neeessitzted by the dedication to Varro, will be more
eonveniently desen-ed till we come to the fragments os the second
edition preserved by Nonius and others. Roughly speaking, the follow-
ing were the contents of the four books> Book L: the historic-»phua
sophim! exposition os Antiochus* views, formerly given by Hortensius,
now by Varum then the niston'ml jumifioetion os the Philonian position,
which eicem had given in the first edition as an answer to l-Ionensius‘⁴
Book ΠΛ m exposition by Cicero os Camendes' positive teaching, prac-
tically the same as tlut given by Catulus in ed„ 1<; to this was appended,
probnbly, that soremste os the negative arguments against dogmatism,
which in ed. 1. had sonned part os the answer made by Cioero ιο Hor-
tensius. Book 111.= a speech os Varro in reply to Cicero, closely
corresponding m that os Lucullus in ed. ι. Book 1V.: Cicero's answer,
substantially the same asin ecl ι, Atticus must have been almost a
