INTRODUCTIOM 47

nt Bnuli'. In the evening, is the wind savoured, Lucullus was to leave
sor his villa at Neapolis, Cicero for his at Pompeii'. Bauli was a litae
place on the guls of Baiae, close to Cimmerium, round which many
legends lingered'. The seenery in view was magnificent‘. As the party
were seated in the xystus with its polished floor and statues and shrubs.
the 'aves rippled at their seer, and the sea away to the horizon glistened
and quivered under the bright sun, and changed colour under the fresh-
euing hreeze. Within sight lay the shore at Cumae and Puteoli, thirty
suffla distant'.

Cicero strove as usual to give vividness to the dialogue and to keep
it persecuy free {mm anachronisms. Diodotus is spoken of as still living,
although when the words were written he had been dead sor some
years‘. The surprise os Hortensius, who is but a learner in philosophy,

mind at Asturz. His intention to visit Tusculum has lest irs mark on
the last section os the book, while in the last but one the De Fimvus,
the De Natura Deorum and other works are shadowed [orth'. In
another passage the design of the fistulati Disputanbns, which was
carried out immediately aster the publication of the Academica and De
Finibus, is clearly to be seen'.

Hortensius and Catulus now sink to a secundm-y position in the
conversation, which is resumed by Lucullus. His speech is especially
scknowledged by Cicero to be drawn smm the works os Antiochus ¹⁶.
Nearly all that is known os the learning os Lucullus is told in Cicem's
dinlogue, and the passages already quoted from the letters. He seems
at least ω have dallied with culture, although his chief energy, as a
private driven, was directed to the care of his fishponds'¹. In his min
