4 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

explicitly stated⁴ Cicero must at this period have nmined an almost
complere snmiliarity with the Epicurean doctrines,

There seems to have been no eminent representat-ive os the Stoic
school then living at Athens. Nor is :ny mention made os a Peripatetic
teadrer whose lectures Cicero might hnve attended, though M. Pupius
Piso, s professes! Pefipntezic, was one os his companions in this sojourn
at Athens'. Only three notable Peripatetics were at this time living.
Ol* these Staseas os Naples, who lived some n'me in Piso's house, was
not then at Athens¹3 it is probable, however, from a mention of him
in the De Oratore, that Cicero knew him through Piso, Diodorus,
the pupil οἰ Critolaus, is frequently named by Cicero, but never as
un acquaintance. Cratippus was atthis rime unknown to him.

The philosopher from whose lessous Cicero denainly learned most
at this period was Antiochus os Ascalon, now the representative ol*
n Stoicised Academic school. Os this teache‘r, however, 1 shall have
to neat later, when 1 shnll attempt to estimate the inlluenoe he exer-
tised over our author* It is sufficient here to say that on the main
point which was in controversy between Philo and Antiochus. Cicero
still continued ro think with his earlier teaeher. 1-1is later works.
however, make it evident that he set u high value on the abilities and
the learning os Antiochus, especially in dialectic, which was taught by
hirn aster Stoie principles. Cicero speaks os him as eminent among
the philosopher: of the time, both for taient and nequirement'5 as a
man of acute intellec& ns possessed or a pointed sty1e¹; in fine,
as the most cultivsted and keenest philosopher os the age‘. A con-
siderable friendship sprung up between Antiochus :md Cioero', which
was strengthened by the fact that many friends uf the latter, such as
Piso‘, Varro, Lucullus and Brutus, more or less adhered to the views
os Antiochus. It is improbable that Cicero at this time became
aequntnred with Aristus the brother of Antiochus. since in the Am—
tkm'ea’ he is mentioned iu such a way as to show that he was unknown
to Cicero in nt: σε.
