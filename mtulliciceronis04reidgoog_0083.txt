It is evident from what has been stated that, although a good many
MSS exist os Atad. I which have never been eollated, or have been only
paxtially cellated, any future examination of uss is not like!y to contri-
bute much to the study os this portion os the work.

As regards the text of the fragments os the Atademia: Posteriora, the
most important os which are preserved by Nonius, Ι bave made mresul
use os the edition os Nonius hy Quicherat (Paris 1872).
