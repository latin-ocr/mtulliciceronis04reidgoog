12 THE A CADEMICS OF CICERO.

ln positiveness of assertion there seemed to Cicero to be something
reekless and unseemly, and destructive os that digniry, halmce, and
control which distinguish the Roman ideal of chameter'. He fre-
quently urges firguments also, which luve had countless panllels in
modern times», to show that the untrammelled conffict of opinion is
necessary to the progress of thought. To sreedom of speculation
Greece owed the preeminenoe οἱ her pffilosophers'. Wherevex autho>
rity had loudly raised ius voice, there philosophy had pined. Pytha-
goras is quoted· us a waming example, and the banesul effecm os
authority are osten depieted‘. The true philosophie spirit, Cicero said,
requires us not to maimain with ohstimcy one view os a subject, but lo
study all view* 1« is a matter os duty to discuss all :specte of every
question. aster the example os the Old Aeademy (ιὶι. the immediate
successors os Plato and os Aristotle‘). These who demand suict dog-
matic formulas are mere busybodies'r The Academics glory in their
sreedom ofjudgmene. Tbey ure not compelled to defend an opinion
whether they will or no, merely because one os their predecessore has
maintained it'. So sar does Cicero carry this freedum, that in the finh
book os the Ilaeseulan Dtirpulatloas he mnintains a view entirely at
varinnce with the whole of the fourth hook os the Dt finibus, and
when the discrepancy is pointed out, refuses ῑο be bound by hir
former statements, on the ples «lut he is an Academic and n free
man'. ‘Modo hoc modo illud probabilius uidemr'.¹ The Aademic
sips the best os every school''. He τουπ-ιε in the wide field os philoso-
phy, while the stoic ἀπιεῖ not stir a soot’s hreudth away from Chry-
sippm=¹¹⁴ The Academic is only anxious that people should combat his
opinions, sor he makes it his uim, with Socrates. to free himself and
others from the mists os err0r¹¹. Π he finds it easier to deoeect error
