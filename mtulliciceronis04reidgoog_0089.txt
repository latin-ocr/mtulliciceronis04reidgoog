the study os the Ciceronian Academica This writer had acquired a
knowledge os the post-Aristotelian philosophy which remained unsur-

would have saved succeeding editors from innumemhle errors. Α work
of the same class, though inferior in merit, is that os Castillon ¹ Livres

it must be admitted that his account os the post-Aristotelian philosophy

ς s. On aa ommam usmis [dium

My one airn in this respect has been, by combining and studyiug the
existing evidence os all kinds, to arrive as nearly as possible at the
orthography which Cicero actually used* lt would however have been
impossible, without encumbering the notes, to give, except ih a few
instances, the reasons which have induced rne to accept certain modes
os spelling, and to reject others. It is common in this country to find
all attemprs ar reforming Latin orthography opposed by the argument
from convenience. 1 um convinccd thar the spelling which rests on the
soundest scientific basis will in the end be round more convenient than
any other. Latin orthography, so sar ns printed texts are eoneerned, is
now in a stare os absolute chaos* Something might indeed he said in
favour of a consistent conventio-aa! spelling to be applied ιο the whole
os Latin literature from first ro last⁴ But scholam never have agreed and
never carr agree on any conventiam] scheme, and were agreement
