b. 771: los! dislogm ‘Catulum'

The whole oi* the characters in this dialog-ne and the lucullus are
among those genuine Optimates and adherenrs os the senatorial party
whom Cioero so loves ιο honour. The Carirlus (mm whom the lost
dialogus was named was son os rhe illustrious colleague os Marius.
With the politica] career of father and sou we shall have little to do. 1
merely inquire what was their position with respect to the philosophy or
the time, md the nature of their connexion with Cicero.

Catulus the younger need not detain us long. 1t is clear from the
lusatiae that he did little more in the dialogue than put toward opinions
he had received srorn his father. Cicero would doubtless have preferred
to introduce the elder man as speaking sor himself, but in that use, ue

Though Cicero sometimes clmes the snther and son together as men ol*
literary culture ind perfect masters of Latin style, it is quite evident on a
caniparison of all the passages where lhe two are mentioned, that no
very high vulue ms placed on the learning of the son'. But however
slight were the claim of Catulus the younger to be considered a philo-
sopher, he was closely linked to Cicero by other ties. During au the
most brilliant period os Cioero's lise, Catulus was one os the soremost
Optimates of Rome, and his character, lise, and influence are osten
depimed in even exrmvagaut langunge by the omror⁷. He is one os the
pillars of the sme', Cicero eries, and desei-ves to be classed with the
