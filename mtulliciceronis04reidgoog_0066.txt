the work it is shown to be not sax distant from the actual time os coru-
position'. Many allusions are made to recent events, such as the utter
overthrow os the Pompeias· party, the death of Tullia', and the publica-
tion os the Hortmius'. Between the date of Tullia's death and the
writing of the Academica, it can bt shown that Varro, Cioero and Atticus
could not have met together a! Cumae. Cicero therefore sor once
admits into his works an impossibility iu fact* This impossibility would
at once occur to Varro. and Cicero anticipans his wonder iu the letter
osdedioetiou‘.

For the mniu facts os Vmo's lise the student must be referred
ω the ordinary sources os information. A short account of the points
os contact between his lise aud that os Cicero, with a few words abqut
his philosophical opinions, ure all that is needed here. The first mention
we have os Varro in any of Cicero’s writings is in itsels sufficient to show
his character md the impossibility os anything like friendship bet'ween
the two. Varro had done the orator some service in the trying time
which came before the exile. ln wrlting to Atticus Cicero had eulogised
Varro ; andin the letter to which 1 refer he begs Atticus ro send Varro
the eulogy to read, adding ⁶ Mirabditer moratus est, sicut nosti, ἱλμιτᾶ καὶ
οὐδέν) All the refereneoe to Varro in the letters to Atticus are in the
same strain. Cicero had to be pressed to write Varro a letter os thanks
{or supposed exertions iu his behalf, during his exile'. Several passages
show that Cicero refused ιο believe in Varro's mal, as reported by
Atticus'. On Cieem’s return srorn exile, he aud Varro remained in the
seme semi-friendly state. About the year 54 ue, as we have already
seen, Atticus in vain urged his friend to dedicate some work to the great
polymth. After the fall οἱ the Pompeiani cause, when most of Ciceros
friends were dead (All. xV1. u, 7), Cicero and Vsu-m do seem to have
been dmm a little closer together, Eight letters, written mostly in the
year before the Academica was published, testisy ιο this approximation'.
Suu they are aul cold, forced and minciah very different from the
letters Cicero addressed to his real intimates, such for instance as
Sulpicius, Caelius, Paetus, Plancus, and Trebatius. They all show a
sent os giving offence to the hmsh temper os varro, und a humility
in presence os his vast learning which is by no means natural to
