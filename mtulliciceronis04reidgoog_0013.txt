and changes os plan have crept in for which 1 owe an apology to
the reader. Some os these are mentioned in the “Addenda and
Corrigenda.n The index has been prepared with special care, and
Ι hope it will render the book usesul in some degree as a work
os reference. The plan of writing the critical notes in Latinis
so obviously convenient and has been so extensively adopted
that it needs no apology.
