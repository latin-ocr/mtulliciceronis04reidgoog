44 THE ACADEMJCS OF CICERO.

Catulus was followed by Hortensius, who in some way spoke in
favour of Antiochean opinions, but ιο what extent is unceruiu'. 1
think it extremely probable that he gave a resume os the history of phi-
losophy, corresponding to the speech os Varro in the beginning os the
Academia Posteriora. One main reason in favour os this view is the
difficulty os understanding to whom, is not to Hortensius, the substance
os -this speech could have been assigned in the first edition. ln the
Academia Postmm it was necessary to make Varro speak first and not
secundas Hortensius did; this accounts sor the disappearance in the
second edition os a polemical argument advanced by Hortensius', which
would be appropriate only in the mouth osone who was answering a speech
already made. On the view 1 have taken, there would be little difficulty
in the fact that Hortensius now advocates a dogmatie philosophy,
though in the lost dialogue which bore his name he had argued against
philosophy altogether', and denied that philosophy and wisdom were at
all the same thing‘. Such a historica] re'sume as 1 have supposed Hor-
tensius to give would be within the reach οἱ any cultivated man ns the
time, and would only lie put sorward ιο show that the New Academie
revolt against the old Academico-Peripatetic school, as viewed by
Antiochus, was unjustifiable There is actual wat-rant for stating that
the exposition given hy Hortensius os Antiochus was merely superficial’.
We are thus relieved from the necessity ol' forcing the meaning os the
words Hortensium nostrum mmmoveris2 from which Krische infers that
the dialogue, enutled Homnsius, had ended in a conversion to philo-
sophy of the orator srom whom it was named. To any such conversim-i
we have nowhere else any allusion.

The relation in which Hortensius stood ιο Cicero, also his character
and attaintnenls, are too well known ιο need mention here. He seems
ιο have been as nearly innocent of any acquaintance with philosophy as
it was possible at the time sor an educated man to bet Cicero‘s
materials sor the speech os Hortensius were, doubtless, drawn from the
worlts o( Antiochus'⁴

The'speech os Hortensius was answered by Cicero himself. If my
view os the-preceding speech is correct, it follows that Cicero in his
reply pursued the sante course which he takes in his answer ιο Varro,
part ol' which is preserved in the Academica Posteriora& He justified
the New Academy by showing that it was in essential hannony with the
