42 THE ACADEMJCS OF CICERO.

Cicero had imitatew, and was well known as a wit aud writer os
epigrams¹.

Altliough so much is said of his general culture, it is only from the
Academia that we lea-rn definitely his philosophical opinions. 1n the
De Oraaetm, when he speaks os the visit os Carneades to Rome', he does
not declare hiniselsa follower of that philosopher, nor does Crassus, in
his long speech about Greek philosophy. connect Catulus with any
particular teacher. The only Greek especially mentioned as a friend of
his, is the poet Antipater of Sidon‘. Still it might have been conchffled,
even from the De Oratore, that he was an adherent either os the Academi:

shows that Catulus could have had no leaning towards the Stoics or

he does in the ease os Antonii-⁵⁸, and Cmssus⁷. It is scarcely possible
that any direct intercourse between Philo and Catulus mn have taken

Philo had a brilliant reputation during the later years of Catulus, and
