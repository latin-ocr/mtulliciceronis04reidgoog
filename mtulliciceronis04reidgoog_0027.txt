10 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

us so much of the later Greek speeulation, which is of vast hiztoriml
vzlue md was doomed to pei-ish in the original Greek. 1 shall speak
hereaster of some canses which have contribuled to produce a low esti-
mate os Cicero's work. But there is one piece os unsairness which Ι
shall have no better opportunity os mentioning than the present. It
is this. Cicero, the philosopher, is rnnde to suffer sor the short-
comings os Cicero the pulitician. Scholnss who have learned to despise
his political wealmess¹ vanily, and irresolution, make haste to depre-
ciate his achievements in philosophy, without troubling themselves to
inquire too closely into their intrinsie value. From political panisan-
ship, and prejudices based on facts irrelevant to the matter in hand,

In the time of Cicero students os philosophy nearly all belonged
to one os two opposing mmps The Stoic and the Epicurean systems

attracted to it any large number of disciples, once when it was founded
by Arcesilas, again under the presidency os Carneades, and lastly
when Philo was at its hend- Philo himself at the end os his lise
ceased to preach the pure doctrine of Carneades, and when he died
the New Academy practieally became extinct'. Meanwhile, Philo's
pupil, Antiochus, had constructed a combination of Stoicisrn, Plato-
niam, and Pedpnteticism, which he dignified by the nnrne os the Old
Academy, and sor which he secured some support. Οἵ this system it
will be necessary to spcak hereasser.

Iu attempting to define Cicero's position with respect to the
various contemporary schools os thought, it will be best to follow the
divizion os philosophy (recognised by all the post-Aristotelian teachers),
into the three branches o( Logic, Ethics, Physics'l For the moment
we may put aside the last-named brai-ich. The only post-Aristotelian
school which possessed a system of physics in all respects peculias to
