70 THE ACADEMICS OF, CICERO.

os the quotations made by Davies shows these collatione to have been
very imperfecti At least Davies osten appeals to them on trivial'rnatters
while he says nothing about thern when dealing with difficult passages
In his notes on Acad. I the nm'ex Eltmsis is quoted ten times only. In
only two os these places has it readings peculiar ro irsels, viz. ᾗ 2 ecqus'd
and§ ²⁴ nou audiuit sor inauditis, both evidently conjectum, the first
being right, the second'wrong. In the notes to the Lutatius the two
codam are indicated thirty-eight timesv but in such a careless way that it
is scarcely ever possible to drnw distinctions between the two. Only in
one place does he contrast rwo different readings of the same passage
drawn from the two codices (Ξ ²7 where El. ι has non satis. El. ι satis).
ln another note (on§ ¹²9) he quotes *ms Eliensis' in the singulm all the
other references are to ‘omnes nostri' or to ⁴Eliens! without distinction.
ln one passage onlya reading is attributed to ‘Eliens’ which is not
found in any other us, viz. struatur sor serentur in 5 94, which, though
adopted by Davies, is decidedly wrong*

Enough has been said tn show that so far at least as the Academica
is cancer-ned, the codices Elr'cnser are not worthy os serious attention

e. Concerning the history os criticism as applied to the Academica ¹.
Of the xvth century printed editions the only one os any use for the
study os the text is the Roman edition of ¹⁴7¹- Το two scholars os the
succeeding century it was principally due that the Latin was purged of
the grossest and most superficial error: that had crept into the uss.
The first os these was the Venetian, Paulus Manutius. whose edition
(¹5⁴0-1545) first laid the foundation of a sound text os Cicero's works
He was sueceeded by Dr Lambinus, who outshone ull his predecessore
in knowledge ol' Latin literature, and particularly os Cicero'. There
were tewweak points in the text on which he did not lay his finger.
But he had two great faults. In the first place he was not content to
try and find out what Cicero did write, hut loved to introduce into the
text countless small alterations which he thought improvements, but
which were without evidence to support thern. Also he destroyed in a
great measure the value os his work by disingenuuusness in rantib-:ring
his own conjectures to iuss sources

To Adnan Turnebus belongs the credit ol* being the first to advance
the interpretation os the Academica by an appeal to the sources os the
ancient philosophy. His commentary on Amd. I was published in
Paris in 1553⁴ ‘thaz ot* P. Faber on both books appeared in 1⁶ir, and
is remarkable sor acute observatiam on the language os the work.
