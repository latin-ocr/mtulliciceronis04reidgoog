40 THE A CADEMICS OF CICERO.

though he be dead, will ever live among his countrymen¹. l-le was not
only glorious in his lise, but fortunate in his death'.

Aput from Cicer-0¹⁵ general agreement with Catulus in ponti-2³, there
were special causes sor his enthusiasm. Catulus was one os the uiri ton—
mlam who had given their unreserved approval to the measures taken
sor the suppression os the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was the first to
confer on Cicero the greatest glory os his lise, the title ‘father os his
country? So closely did Cicero suppos· himself to be :nied to Catulus,
that a friend tried to console him sor the death of Tullia. by hidding him
remember ‘Catulus and the olden times⁷.' The statement or Catulus,
osten referred to by Cicero, that Rome had never been so unfortunate
as to have two bad consuls in the same year, except when Cinna held
the office, was intended to point a contrast between the zeal of Cicero
and the lukewaxmness os his eolleague Antonius'. Archias, who
engnged to write a poem in honour os Ciceru's consulship, lived in [he
house of the two eatuli'.

ι We have seen that when Cicero found it too late to withdraw the
first edition of the Amdemiea from circulation, he affixed a prooemium to
each book, Catulus being lauded in the first, Lucullus in the second.
From the passages above quoted, and from our knowledge os Cioero‘s
habit in such matters. we can have uo difficultyin conjecturing ar least a
portion os the centenis os the lost prooemium to the Catulus. The
achievernents os the elder Catulus were probably extolled, as well as
those os his son. The philosophica knowledge os the elder man was
made to cast its lustr-e on the younger. Cicero's glorious consulship
was once more lauded, and grat stress was laid upon the patronage it
received from so §amous a man as the younger Catulus, whose pmises
were sung in the {ervid language which Cicero lavishes on the same
theme elsewhere. Some allusion most likely was made ιο ὼε con-
nexion of Archias with the Catuli, and to the poem he lud promised ro
