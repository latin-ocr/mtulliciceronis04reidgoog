INTRODUCTION. 13

than to discover tri-th. the fault lies in the nature of things, and not in
him ¹. The New Awdeniy at all times dwelt much on the eriiiml and
destructive side of the Socmtie and Platonic reachings'. It inter-
preted the constructive dialogues os Plato by vhe light of the ‘dia-
logues of searchss and mainmined thnt the founder os the Academy
never dreanied os Setting forth his doctrines as anything more than
snempts to find the truth. This view os Plato's dialogues seems to
have been pretty widely accepted in Cicero's time, even by dogmatic
teaehersffi

While rejoicing in this boundless freedoni of thought, Cicero indig-
nanssy repels the charge that the Academy, though elsiming to seelr
sor the truth, effaces the distinction between the true and rhe salse,
and ean therefore find no truth to sollow‘. Truth is identified with
probability nnd not with cenainry'.

Another consideration which mmeted Cicero to these teneus was
their evident adaptabiiity to the purposes ns orator-y, and the fact that
eloquenee was, as he pus it, the child os the Academy‘. Orators,
politicians, and rnen os letters lud ever found their best nour-ishment in
the teaching of the Academic and Peripatetic masters', while the Stoica
and Epicurnns enred nothing sor power of expression* Again, the
Amdemic rences were those with which the common sense of the world
was most in sympathy'. The Acaderny moreover was the school which
had the most respectable pedigree. Philo was the successor, in n
direct line, os Socrates and Plato. All other systems, which could not
tace their origin to these philosophus, had a plebeian appearance!
The philosopher who best preserved the Socrati: tradition was most
esrimable, menis parn'bus, and that philosopher was Carneadesm, whom
Philo unhesitatingly followed at the rime when Cicero heard him.

Before we proceed tn state the ethica] views οἱ Cicero, it will be
convenient to discuss one or two matters which concern his entire
attitude with regard to philosophy. Though he described himself
ns a New Academic, he has in modern tin-ies far ostener been named
