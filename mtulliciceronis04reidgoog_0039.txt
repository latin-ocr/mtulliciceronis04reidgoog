22 THE ACADEMJCS 01⁷ CICERO.
to keep silence concerning a little-known writer, about whom his
readers would not expect him to express an opinion ¹.

Cicero hated and despised Epicureanism most simei-ely, and one
of his chief ainis in undertaking his philosophis-21 works was to stem
the tide os its populurity in Italy. At the same time, us ι pati-iot,
he felt shame thzt the literature of his country should be destitute
just where Greek was richest- He osten tries by the most tas-setelied
arguments to shew that philosophy had lest its mark on the Italian
peoples in early tirnes'. We have seen that there were many men of
culture who did not object to philosophy so long asit was taught and roed
ln Greek To these he replies with indignation, accusing then-i os being
untrue to their coumry'. It would be a glor-iou: thing, he thinks, is
Romans were rio longer absolutely compelled to reson to the Greeks‘.
He will not even concede that Greek is a richer tangue than Latin‘.
As sor the alleged inoepacity os the Roman intellect to deal with
philosophica inquiries, he will not hear os it. n is only, he says,
because the energy of the nation has been diverted into other channels
that so little progress has been made in this direction. The history os
Roman orator-y is referred to in support of this opinion& Is only nn im-
pulse were given at Rome to the pumuit os philosophy, already on the
wirne in Greece, Cicero thought that it would flourish and take the
place o( oratory, which he believed to be expiring amid the din os civil
wast. He rnoreover clearly foresaw thaz the abolitlon os the old consti-
tution os the state would drlve many Romans in future to seek con-
solation in absumet studies*⁴

There can be no doubt ilmt Cicero was pcnexmted by the belief
that if he wrote on philosophy he would do his country :i real service*-
