INTRODUCTION. 3 ι
Another view os the συντάγματι is that they represent the Alademr'ca
which was at first divided into two books Against this Madvig urged a
singularly unfortunate ubjection. He held that the word σύνταγμα
could not be applied to a portion os a work. This judgment is very
nearly the reverse os the truth3 the fact being that the word nearly
always is so applied wherever it occurs¹. Its use is indeed a very
strong argument against the opinion os Madvig, nnd tells equally against
the contentiori of Krische that the books in question were the Honensius
und the Academica. The Hortensius is never mentioned in eicero‘s
letters, and it may possibly have been finished before he wemto Astura&
There is therefore strong ground sor supposing thaz by the ‘rruvra'ypma'
Cicero meant the Academica as he first wrote it.

Whatever be the tuith on this point it cannot be disputed that the
Horreum« znd the Acadaemica must have been more closely connected,
in style and tone, than any other two works of Cicero. The interiocw
turs in the two dizlogues were exactly the same, for the introductioni os
the name os Balbus into some Cragments os the Hortensius is an error'.
