INTROD υεηοΝ. 35

ness'- Again and again Cicero proressed to doubt whether Varro really
desired to receive the dedication ς again and again Atticus assured him
that on that scere there was nothing to tear. still Cicero was not satisfied,
md wished Atticus to state exactly the grounds he had for this eonfi-
denee'. Atticus seems ω have thought thzt Cieero's hesitation was
mused by the possibility that pet-ple might accuse him os hunting aster
notoriety is he dedimted anything to Varro without being first chal-
lenged by a similar dedication from Varro. This idea Cicero denies'.
In order to stimulate his friend, Atticus affirmed that Varro was jealous
of some to whom Cicero had shown more favour. We find Cicero
eagerly nsking sor more insornution on this point: was it Brutus of
whom Varro was jealous⁴? It seems strange that Cicero should nor
hnve entered into correspondente with Varro himself. But the lite-
rary etiquene of the day seems to have required that the recipient
os ι dedimtion should be assumed to be ignorant of the donor's in-
tentions fill they were on the very point of being carried out. Thus
although Cicero saw Brutus frequently while at Tusculum, he apparently
did not speak ιο him »bour the De Finffius, but employed Atticus tu
ascenain his feeling about the dedkation'.

Cicero's own judgment concerning the completed second edition ot*
the Academica is several times given in the letters* He tells us that it
extende-i on the wh01e to greater length than the first edition, though
much had been omitted, and adds ‘unless human seli-love deoeives me,
the books have been so finished that the Greeks themselves have no-
thing iu the mne department of literature to approach thern... This
edition will be more brilliant, more teme, and altogether better than the
last'ff Agaiu: ‘the Antiochean portion hus all the keenness os Antio-
chus combined with any polish my style may possess⁷.' Also: ‘1 have
finished the work with 1 know not what success, buz with a mre which
nothing could sui-pass? In another passage he calls them 'sane argu-
