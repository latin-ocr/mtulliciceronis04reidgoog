mining nine. The other three later τρόποι are logical txieks, directed
against the possibility ο( dmonsuadon, no one os which is exactly
given in the Academica. The first shows that proos is impossible,
because to prove anything assumptions must be made, aud these
sssumptions require proof, and so on ad infinitum. The second meets
the claim of the dogmatist to have some unproved hypothesis admitted
as a basis os proos, by pointing out that the sceptie can ezsily propose
an unproved hypothesis destructive os that put forward on the uther
side'. The last ‘method’ is the ‘method os alterumtion'! To dis-
tinguish a true from a false proni a criterion is needed, but to show
the criterion true a proos is needed and so the argument osculares to
infinity between eriteriun and proos. These three ‘tropes’ were no doubt

The two ‘tropes' which Sextus attributes to some later sceptics
really constitute the homs of n dilemma, which shewed that in every
instance where knowledge was asserted, one of two among the five
‘tmpes' might be used, viz. that based on the diversity ot* judgments,
and that which calls for proof upon proos to infinity¹.
