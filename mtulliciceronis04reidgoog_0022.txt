philosophy; in Asia and at Rhodes he devoted himself principally to
rhetoric, under the guidmce of the most noted Greek machus, chief
of whom was his old friend Molo, the head ο( the Rhodim
school& Cicero however formed while at Rhodes one friendship which
largely influeneed his vlews of philosophy, that with Posidonius the
pupil of Panaetius, the most famous Stoic ο( the age. To him Cicero
makes reference in his works ostener than to any other instructor. He
speaks of him ns the greatest of the Stoics'; as a most notzble philo-
sopher, to visit whom Pompey, in the midst of his eastern mnpaigns,
put himself to much trouble· ς n a minute inquker‘. He,is scarcely
ever mentioned without some expression of affection, :nd Cicero tells
us that he read his works more than those os my other Stoi: author'.
Posidonius was at a later time resident at Rme‘, and stayed in Cicero’s
house. Hei-ato the Rhodiam another pupil of Panaetius, rnay have
been ιι Rhodes at this time. Mnesarchus and Dardanus, also hearets
of Panaetius, belonged to an earlier time, and although Cicero was
well acquainted with the works of the former, he does not seem to
have known either persona-ily.

From the year 77 to the year 68 nc. when the ser-ies οἱ letters

affairs to spend much time in systematic study. 'rint his oi-utory owed
much to* philosophy from the first he repeatedly insists3 and we know
from his letters that it was his later practice to refresh his style h'y
much study os the Greek writen, and especially the philosophers,
During the period then. about which we have little or no iriforrnntion,
we may believe that he kept up his old knowledge by converse with
his many Roman friends who lud a bont towards philosophy, as well
as with the Greeks who frorn time to time came to Rome and fre-
quented the houses of the Optimum to this intercourse he added such
radingas his leisure would allow. The letters contained in the first
book of those addressed to Atticus, which unge over the years 68—62
nc„ nfford many proofs os the abiding strength of his passion for
literary employment. In the earlier part of this time we find him
entreating Atticm to let him have a librat-y which was then sor snle3
